<p dir="ltr">The objective of this project is to create a reference application using the Open Source CommCare platform to implement the operational requirements pertaining to WHO Antenatal care recommendations in digital systems. This reference application that is proposed to be developed  will provide functionalities for digital tracking  and include features such as workflows, decision support, scheduling logic, reporting indicators, etc, that can be used by  community health community health workers and their supervisors for  enabling key health services  targeting the improvement of key health indicators  and monitoring of performance metrics .</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mobile data collection has been proven to aid the maternal and child health sector. Research has shown that digital interventions can increase antenatal care by 41% and improve facility delivery rates by over 100%. Programs featuring mobile data collection have also highlighted increased participation of family members in antenatal care, with husbands engaging 60% and mothers-in-law 110% more often as compared to  paper-based systems. Dimagi’s mobile based tools have demonstrated effective monitoring and improving the quality of maternal, antenatal and postnatal care. </p>

<p dir="ltr">For example,in Ethiopia, The Last Ten Kilometers 2020 (L10K 2020) project covers 17 million Ethiopians with improved maternal and newborn health outcomes. Implemented by JSI through funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), the project is supporting the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) in 115 rural districts of four of the most populous regions of the country (Amhara, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’[SNNP], and Tigray regions). L10K 2020 is working to forge sustained linkages between communities and the primary health system of the country through strengthening the provision of quality community-led interventions and facility-based care, and ensuring new and innovative pathways to generate demand for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services.Dimagi has directly contributed by building an innovative mobile solution to improve post natal care in the first 48 hours after birth, by leveraging the benefits of mobile technology’s connection to the hardest-to-reach parts of the country. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Similarly, the <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/case-studies/mhealth-crs-india/">ReMiND project in Uttar Pradesh</a>, India, is a well established  example of using mobile health technology to increase key maternal and newborn health practices. Through ReMiND, Dimagi has enabled Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in using CommCare to help ASHAs counsel and evaluate women and their newborns for danger signs, both before and after birth. Our partner Living Goods created the Smart Health app that uses a basic clinical decision support system (CDSS) to ensure consistent and accurate diagnoses of  pregnancy care, childhood diseases, nutrition, family planning, and immunization tracking through smart workflows. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The proposed investment from Digital Square will specifically go towards creating a reference digital system on CommCare that can be leveraged by users to meet the operational requirements for implementing WHO recommendations.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Goal of the project </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The goal of the project is to align the existing CommCare product to be configured for the WHO DAK (Digital Adaptation Kit) to position it a) for wider adoption in low-resource settings b) enable the implementation of standardized protocols of care for pregnant mothers c) Enforce  standards of care through a digitised model that can be used across geographies for improved health outcomes for women.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How will the goal be achieved</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Dimagi and Living Goods will collaborate to create a reference mobile software application that will be developed on  the existing CommCare platform. The business workflows of the reference application will aim to support health services for maternal care through the stages of pregnancy and postpartum phases and early newborn care as outlined in the MNCH DAK. The application will be designed to be intuitive with highly usable workflows that can be adapted for different primary care contexts.   Initially, we will work with a well established and highly common superset  of workflows, which we will validate in a live setting and   iterate through stakeholder and user discussions. We will progressively improvise on the solution  in consultation with the various stakeholders in subsequent stages. The application will be modular so that it can be easily adapted to meet the capacity of the health workers and operational needs in different  countries or in primary care programs. The reference application will be accompanied by a comprehensive set of documentation, training tools,sample reports for CHWs and their supervisors and an interface (please refer to the section on “deliverables” for a detailed view of the slated deliverables of this project) that will make it possible for program managers to provide requisite administrative support . All these tools shall be available to any organisation after the formal release of the said reference system. </p>

<p><strong>How will your organization’s expertise contribute to project goals</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Dimagi and Living Goods are joining hands to create a strong and symbiotic partnership to achieve the project goals based on their value add and past project expertise. </p>

<p>While Dimagi has extensive experience across a wide range of sectors,  our consolidated experience in  more than 58 MNCH projects globally, implemented on  CommCare, has provided deep insights on technology design that is required to support CHWs working directly with mothers and their children. These projects have equipped over 4,000 CHWs with CommCare in countries including Bangladesh, Benin, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. </p>

<p>Dimagi has implemented a large-scale nutrition program on CommCare that was used by more than 650,000 CHWs . This solution enabled CHWs who were equipped with mobile tools to focus on improved service delivery, enable effective monitoring of growth for children upto the age of 5, ensure timely interventions for children with acute malnutrition and enhance decision support to improve maternal and child nutrition/health indicators. </p>

<p>With CommCare, CHWs are able to do their work more efficiently by supplementing or eliminating the need for paper records and providing them with a job aid that supports service delivery, improved counseling, decision-making, and referrals. </p>

<p>Living Goods works with governments and partners  and in the process leverages a powerful combination of catalytic technology, high-impact training, and quality treatments that empower government community health workers (CHWs) to deliver quality care to their neighbors’ doorsteps. </p>

<p>Living Goods partners with local and national governments to improve health outcomes at the community level with a specific focus on high ROI areas of intervention, specifically those shown to decrease maternal and under-five child mortality. Living Goods has supported over 10,000 community health workers serving over 9 million people across Kenya and Uganda over the past 15 years. Living Goods equips each CHW with a smartphone and digital job aid that guides high quality community health service delivery and supports rigorous performance management. Living Goods’ service delivery model (DESC) includes digitally-enabling CHWs, equipping CHWs with necessary training, medications and diagnostics to be effective; supporting supervision through CHW performance analytics; and compensating CHWs with payment for delivering quality healthcare to patients. </p>

<p>Dimagi and Living Goods will bring about distinctive value through our combined past experience in building this reference digital application based on  the WHO DAK recommendations that will not only encourage uniform adoption of digital enabled interventions to improve the health outcomes of mothers undergoing antenatal care, but also serve as a means for the adopters to benchmark care requirements.</p>

	</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr"><em><strong> 2.    Scale and deployment</strong></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"> As part of the current scope, no deployment of the developed reference application is being envisaged. The largest installation of CommCare had more than 650,000 Community Health Workers in a single instance of the software.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">The reference application will be developed on the CommCare platform that has a demonstrated track record of deployment at scale. CommCare is used by 2000+ international development projects across 300+ partners in 80+ countries to transform their last-mile data collection and service delivery requirements. </p>

<p dir="ltr"> <strong><em>3. Alignment with the Instant OpenHIE deployment approach</em></strong> </p>

<p dir="ltr">CommCare is fully compliant with OpenHIE  standards and aligns with the deployment approach. The CommCare ecosystem consists of integrations with tools for M&amp;E teams, research teams, mobile applications and automation platforms. CommCare’s compliance with OpenHIE standards have been used in MOTECH. </p>

<p dir="ltr">MOTECH is an open source server platform that supports the integration of scalable mobile services (mServices) and health information systems. It is designed to enable integration with a set of self-service features, enabling the sharing of data between systems to be configured without software developers or code changes. MOTECH already supports integration in Bihar, India between 3 systems: with DHIS2, the Mother Child Tracking Service MCTS ; CommCare and OpenMRS.  In addition, MOTECH implements the OpenHIE Case Services Discovery (CSD) API which enables integration with Health Worker Registries and Facility Registries, in compliance with IHE. MOTECH can be used to establish common, OpenHIE-compliant registries for providers, facilities, and clients. Other eHealth and mHealth efforts can be engaged as consumers to the MOTECH OpenHIE registries. MOTECH is currently being used to: </p>

The program was also replicated to 50 health clinics in Mali. More than 2.6 million children have been registered in the REC system, facilitating over 4.4 million clinical consultations. These consultations include tens of thousands of coaching sessions, where IMCI protocol experts provide direct feedback to clinicians.Terre des Hommes kicked off a transfer of program ownership to the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso. Within 2 years, the Burkina Faso MOH intends to take on full responsibility for the IeDA program.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">In September of 2016, USAID DIV awarded a three-year grant to Living Goods, with an extension of one-year to build on the success of its CHW model in Kenya. With DIV funding, strategic input, and influence, Living Goods aimed to make its CHW platform an exemplar for maximizing health impact at the lowest cost. </p>

			<p dir="ltr"> </p>

			<p dir="ltr">Key Accomplishments:</p>

			<p dir="ltr"> </p>

			<ul><li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">Living Goods Kenya has reduced cost per capita from a baseline of $4.76 in 2016 down to $3.54 and continues to seek ways to maximize cost efficiency and value for money moving forward.</p>
				</li>
				<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">Secured a first-of-its-kind contract with Kenya’s Isiolo County to help establish a sustainable community health system over the next four years. Isiolo County also represents our sixth county in Kenya.</p>
				</li>
				<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">Won permission from local regulators to expand the list of regulated medicines, diagnostics, and services that CHWs can offer, thereby influencing local policy to amplify impact. Living Goods results and quality control measures enabled this expanded permission, allowing CHWs to, for example, offer antibiotics to treat pneumonia and administer rapid tests for malaria.</p>
				</li>
				<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">Launched a global advocacy campaign—along with partners Amref Health Africa, Aspen Management Partnership for Health, Financing Alliance for Health, the International Rescue Committee, and Last Mile Health (LMH)—called Communities at the Heart of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure that community health programs that are government-owned, financially sustainable, and committed to quality outcomes are included in national UHC strategies. The campaign has since grown to include 70 member organizations.</p>
				</li>
				<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">Designed and deployed best-in-class mobile health tools. CHWs capture data on services they provide via Living Goods’ mobile app co-designed with its partner Medic Mobile— enabling real-time monitoring, optimizing, and verification of results and transparency for funders.</p>
				</li>
				<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">Worked with BRAC, PSI, and CARE to support them in delivering comparable impact in Uganda, Myanmar, and Zambia. It is also partnering with LMH, another leading community health partner that operates in Liberia, to scale and finance CHWs throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

		</tr></tbody></table><p>Through the application, Dimagi will aim to align its pre-existing <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/">CommCare platform </a>to the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for MNCH as referred to in the Notice F.  Existing workflows will be adapted to align to gaps identified. This includes inclusion of specialised workflows, decision support logic and reporting indicators for CHWs and supervisors for MNCH programs. The specific skill sets of this consortium relative to Notice F are :</p>

<ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Contextualisation to country scenarios: One of the numerous examples of Dimagi’s effort at contextualisation of standardised mobile health applications in several countries was to supplement global health and nutrition programs with mobile technology by deploying a MOTECH suite. This has been effectively used by <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/case-studies/mhealth-world-vision-motech/">Grameen Foundation and World Vision</a> in several of their program countries. Additionally, Living Goods has also extensively worked in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Myanmar, Kenya and Uganda in strengthening country based health systems and partnered with governments to strengthen community health.</p>
	</li>
</ul><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Partnerships with diverse stakeholders: Dimagi’s focus has been on improving maternal and reproductive health in resource poor countries by coordinating with local governments. For example, Dimagi partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Health and Tula Salud to introduce a digital health program for frontline health workers. The features included case management, custom reports, decision and diagnostic support, WHO Z scores, clinical workflows, transportation coordination and referral follow-ups. Additionally, please refer to the above section on similar experiences for more examples of coordination with country governments and taking over of the program by the incumbent governments to mainstream its use.</p>
	</li>
</ul><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Diverse program background: Since November 2012, USAID has published mHealth compendiums that highlight mHealth projects in Africa, with a few from around the world. Dimagi and CommCare were featured in six of the 30 case studies in the fourth and <a href="http://www.africanstrategies4health.org/uploads/1/3/5/3/13538666/usaid_mhealth_compendium_vol._4_final.pdf">most recent mHealth compendium.</a> Some of the featured projects include using CommCare to support MNCH with World Vision in the Middle East, fighting gender-based violence with RTI International in India, and supporting community health workers in Mozambique.</p>
	</li>
</ul><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Experience in enabling Precision tasking for CHWs: With funding from Goldsmith Foundation and through a partnership with Digital Square (PATH), Dimagi built a Precision Tasking Framework, which is a customizable solution to enable users to create data-driven tasks for CHW and supervisors. It enables them to enhance performance, prioritize life-saving tasks, and improve key health metrics. This framework is built for enabling digitized service delivery, data sharing, a unified patient view, and advanced reporting capabilities.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>Dimagi and Living Goods have a history of collaboration. Dimagi is a partner with the Ministry of Health in Burkina Faso and Living Goods for an implementation of CommCare in Burkina Faso for a digitally enabled CHW program that will reach 800 CHWs and 480,000 people in 2022, with the goal of expanding nationally over a 3 year period. In addition, in collaboration with JSI Research &amp; Training Institute (JSI), the lead partner, and Dimagi, Living Goods will help strengthen and accelerate performance management as the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) scales its electronic community health information system (eCHIS) beyond the 1,500 HEWS it currently supports. The roles and responsibilities of both partners are illustrated below:</p>

<p>Dimagi will lead and manage the work on the strength of the following factors: </p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Similar programming experiences: Dimagi and partners have been working together for years to develop programs and technologies that improve health outcomes for mothers and their children. The benefits of Dimagi’s mobile solutions are 1) Case sharing enables users to send medical information directly to referral facilities and improve lines of communication between field and clinical work. 2) Digital forms improve protocol adherence for community health workers and help to identify symptoms in mothers and children requiring emergency care.3) Mobile apps can support online and offline data collection, facilitate record keeping, and generate easily shareable reports for community health workers.</p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Dimagi team capabilities: Dimagi’s staff includes software engineers, health systems architects, and clinicians in a tight-knit team.

</ol><ol start="3"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Living Goods experience: Since 2007, Living Goods has worked alongside governments and partners to support strengthening of health systems at the community level to save and improve millions of lives. Living Goods provides CHWs, a smartphone equipped with a powerful diagnostic mobile app, which acts as a job aide and enables improved performance management to drive health impact. The Living Goods model enables close supervision and monitoring of CHW performance and ensures that they are always stocked with essential medicines and health products. Importantly, CHWs focus on the impact areas where they can make the biggest difference, including pregnancy and newborn care, childhood illnesses, referring high-risk cases, nutrition, family planning, and immunization. Living Goods provides a wide range of technical assistance to community health digitalization programs in Kenya, Burkina Faso, Uganda and Ethiopia as well as new countries.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite notable progress, the world had fallen short of Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) targets of 75% reduction in MMR till the year 2015. From 2000 to 2017, the global Maternal Mortality Rate declined by 38 per cent – from 342 deaths to 211 deaths per 100,000 live births.This translates into an average annual rate of reduction of 2.9 per cent. While substantive, this is still less than half the 6.4 per cent annual rate needed to achieve the Sustainable Development global goal of 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.Two regions, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, account for 86 per cent of maternal deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africans suffer from the highest maternal mortality ratio – 533 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, or 200,000 maternal deaths a year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The reasons for maternal mortality continues to be hemorrhage, accounting for a quarter of the deaths reported.Similar proportion of maternal deaths were caused indirectly by pre-existing medical conditions aggravated by pregnancy. Other contributing reasons include lack of quality of care competencies, inconsistent quality of care and limited capacities of CHWs in early diagnosis of complications and high risk pregnancies. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The World Health Organisation’s Global Strategy for Digital Health is to improve health for everyone, everywhere by accelerating the development and adoption of appropriate, accessible, affordable, scalable and sustainable person centric digital health solutions.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Digital health should:</p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Accessible and should support equitable and universal access to quality health services; </p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Enhance the efficiency and sustainability of health systems in delivering quality, affordable and equitable care</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Strengthen and scales up health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, management, rehabilitation and palliative care</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Be a system that respects the privacy and security of patient health information</p>
	</li>
</ol><p>Here the four guiding principles of digital health and how Dimagi’s experience in implementing at-scale projects caters to each of the guiding principles of Global Digital Health and catalyses the planned and systematic adoption of digital in countries affected by high maternal mortality rates:</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Reference implementation of WHO DAK recommendations  in CommCare will be modularised to ensure that the application can be primed to work in different country health systems and will suit the requirements of CHWs in different countries</p>

			<p dir="ltr">We have observed a trend of more and more LMICs deploying electronic Community Health Systems built by engineers working in their government agencies. Inevitably, once the work starts there is urgency to move quickly and build such systems in a relatively short time. This reference implementation serves as an ideal building block for such scenarios and provides holistic, well researched, standards based solutions for quick adoption.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">CommCare, Dimagi’s product, is a powerful mobile service delivery and data collection platform that supports longitudinal tracking. Apps built on CommCare and aim to help frontline workers or caseworkers more accurately track and support the registration, follow-up, and completion of frontline services and behavior change communication activities in their communities. CommCare operates on mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.), and is built on a decision and logic-processing platform that supports care delivery and provides critical data-quality checks at point-of-service. So CommCare fulfills a lot of health tracking needs as part of its integrated strategy</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Additionally, CommCare can be used to track wider health needs of the community. Some of the wider health projects where CommCare applications have been used <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/blog/archive/latest-partners/">is here</a></p>

			<p dir="ltr">As pointed out earlier, this reference implementation on WHO DAK is among a category of sector specific offerings that Dimagi is strategizing to widen its adoption, by developing internationally recognized health protocols. Its other project funded by Goldsmith Foundation and PATH Digital Square was a precision tasking application for CHWs to enable them to target and prioritise their services for people who needed them most</p>

		</tr></tbody></table><p>Dimagi has deployed over 200 projects in MCH and nutrition globally. Many of its maternal and child health programs have graduated to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L7wSzKA-FI38hCLIHmhXE8aM83YAJAXF8OVxf2NUYdQ/edit?usp=sharing">national programs </a>and have been taken over by incumbent governments. For example, Dimagi has successfully implemented the largest e-nutrition program in the world, under the POSHAN Abhiyaan. The program that was launched in India, helped tackle malnutrition by digitally equipping more than 650,000 frontline workers across the country with a mobile solution that improved service delivery and enabled effective monitoring, timely interventions, and enhanced decision support. In addition, the Integrated e-Diagnostic Approach (IeDA) project is a national-scale initiative led by Terre des Hommes, a Swiss NGO, to improve the quality of care that children under five receive in clinical consultations in Burkina Faso. IeDA includes the Registre Electronique de Consultations (REC), a mobile diagnostic support tool for nurses, digitizing the IMCI and built on the CommCare platform. By automating critical tasks, the diagnostic accuracy and speed was greatly improved. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Dimagi and its experience of developing digital health tools according to evidence based recommendations is fully aligned and able to take up this assignment of Reference Implementation of the WHO digital application kit for ante-natal care. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The development of the CommCare application will be done in India.The Dimagi team is in the process of development of a number of mobile applications and digital tools which use functionalities such as decision support, workflows, user scenarios and personas. These WHO DAK recommendations for its RMNCH related digital tools will complement the development of these digital tools and add to the functionality. Users of CommCare will get these functionalities at no additional charge in all their applications. This will ensure the following outcomes: </p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">CommCare application will adhere to WHO clinical, public health and data use guidelines and facilitate consistency in collection and use of data</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">The tracking system will progressively shift to a patient centred approach with digital tracking and decision support system</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Digital health team and application developers in Dimagi will have a shared and higher understanding of health content, including additional user scenarios and business workflows within the digital system and have a transparent mechanism to review the validity and accuracy of the health content, thus improving user experience at the field level. </p>
	</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr">This project complements the digital tool development process at Dimagi and is an ongoing project .</p>

<p dir="ltr"> </p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Digital Health Technologies </strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">This project will use Dimagi’s flagship technology platform, CommCare, which is an award-winning, open source mobile case management platform that supports frontline workers (FLWs) in tracking their clients through a continuum of service delivery. CommCare is used by close to one million frontline workers around the world, who are cumulatively tracking tens of millions of people and submitting more than 5 million forms a day via the system. By running as an application on a mobile phone, CommCare is built on a decision and logic-processing platform that can support partners in delivering a wide range of services. It also provides critical data-quality checks and calculations at each point of service. The tool aims to help partners track and support client registration and follow-up alongside CommCareHQ, the web platform that includes workforce performance monitoring dashboards designed to assist project managers in better supporting frontline workers as they deliver critical program interventions in the field. CommCare is a cloud-based, HIPPA-compliant, GDPR-compliant, open-source mobile platform and Global Good that supports data collection, decision-support, client tracking, SMS-interaction, and map-based visualizations.</p>

<p>CommCare will consist of two components:</p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">CommCare Mobile is the mobile-based portion of CommCare used for data collection and service delivery. CommCare Mobile can be used on a phone or tablet and, in rare instances, through a computer. Through CommCare Mobile, a community health worker (CHW) will be able to access a mobile application and collect and view relevant data. </p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">CommCare HQ is the website (<a href="http://www.commcarehq.org/?__hstc=240960668.6f1b377f489327698c5d40b6744857ea.1612955579626.1612955579626.1612955579626.1&amp;__hssc=240960668.14.1612955579626&amp;__hsfp=1557194150">www.commcarehq.org</a>) which will be used for application management and reporting. Through the CommCare HQ website, we can design applications, access data, and manage its CHWs.  CommCare HQ will receive the data submitted by CHWs using CommCare Mobile.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr">We will be able to use CommCare for a number of purposes including: </p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Data collection - CHWs can directly digitize information on their phones so that it can be accessed via a computer</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Decision support - will support complex logic that can guide the CHW in asking the right questions and providing appropriate advice</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Job aid - CommCare can help CHWs to prioritize tasks, remind users to make visits, and do complex calculations</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Better supervision - data on CHW activity can be used to inform supportive supervision</p>
	</li>

<p dir="ltr">This project will have its own project space on CommCare HQ with its own name. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The project space (or project) will be a secure web portal in the CommCare system that will contain all data related to their CommCare applications, as well as tools that will help manage and deploy the application.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Here are some of the key parts of the CommCare HQ Project Space for this project</p>

<ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Reports - view and download worker activity, performance reports, and individual form submissions</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Data - download raw data exports</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Users - manage the web and mobile users for the project</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">

	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><img alt="" height="51" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mlvJrPun7gbu_kSNqqTBpGPkbqz7S0CUXscPHiBszR7KrDCONWRqcLq7DaVn9SOHsmeopp_Oj1tNN-PVKu-Xv-pRxQH9Yy-23L373kRWSfZhBS9-MDtWN2DDKBGyTg" width="624" /></p>

<p dir="ltr">We discuss below the building blocks of the proposed application:</p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">The basic unit of work in CommCare is called a form. A basic form will usually contain a series of questions. We will build all the forms over the course of program delivery and then link them together in the application. Forms are fully customisable and will support all kinds of useful features such as skip logic and validation. A form can contain text, number, date or multiple choice questions.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr"><img alt="" height="369" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yFA8GkMBXCtkOj_ZfrKlxuAf73u3p2DZOMEQdrLvggisywsWfEnDT4vu6rwQ8P89DRNu8YNexzxeAvVjW2CDSP5lHigysebypiejDDZ0EhaQFu7MhIOXWF7k1tECSg" width="264" /></p>

<ol start="2"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">CommCare will also use menus, which are groups of forms that are all related to the same type of thing.  A menu can have one or many forms, and an application could have many menus; it is like a folder full of forms that are all about the same thing.There will be two basic types of menus:</p>
	</li>
</ol><ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Surveys will allow us to set up forms that are used for one-time data collection. This can be used if we do not need to track data over time.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Case Lists will allow us to set up forms that create, manage or close cases that we will  create for this project. </p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6x7FmBtu1__G-4mp3j9_h2oLX7eVN2FDZ93ebaa73dBQbl6eRWbLSA0EkeJUa94Vn7Nv6oeVBmptrBxljp1OIkF_4Qn5826cmTxzajUVmbziDOf_PewO_XKXbZQ2Sw" width="416" /></p>

<ol start="3"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">In CommCare, a case is something that partners can track over time with the CommCare mobile application. Below are some examples of things that might be considered cases in CommCare. </p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="4"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">CommCare will let CHWs update a case which links all of the forms together - this process of creating case records and updating them over time is called case management in CommCare.Once a case is created, the CHW will be able to locate it on the mobile application by accessing the Case List. This will be configured while designing the application on CommCareHQ  to contain key information about the case. The Case List can be sorted or filtered in different ways for example, in alphabetical order.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p dir="ltr"> <img alt="" height="258" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bwzwq4qku7qmWNpKTlfNmd6HdiNf5sW0aT6pZb-AA8iMPzRyEalyD-VB-vkbFjFax2FFtkIFCD5lyEzEDjora3edoD3gbrDLeUQEY1rFcTNyMZx4VXBHN0Y4UkLsww" width="145" /></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Data flow in CommCare</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Data flow in CommCare is depicted below:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" height="234" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KV7Bm7pHVm472OcmfR8OJbNVi5pn5q4zjVsybI5tcbIvVhZ4_s7Dk9O65HpHaXEFXDwlQTFoWexz4NEhIaJ14coA5oCvbH_4FyQxSnPgnAqz-P9NR3LmcfVRdnJ7_g" width="236" /></p>

<p dir="ltr">As you can see in the figure above, there are three main steps in the data flow process:</p>

<ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">First - Data is entered into forms via CommCare Mobile</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Second - Data is submitted via cellular phone networks or Wi-Fi networks to the CommCare HQ server</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Third - Data is accessible and downloadable via the CommCare HQ website</p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">When there is no signal, data stays on the phone until there is signal! CommCare was designed to function in places where there is not always consistent access to the network.As soon as the mobile user is able to connect to a network, all the data on the phone is sent to the server and available on CommCare HQ.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Types of Data Captured by CommCare</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"> In general, two types of data are captured by CommCare:</p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Raw Data: this is data from the questions and answers contained in a form. Raw data can be analysed and will help CHWs to understand progress towards program indicators and program effectiveness.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Worker Activity Data: this is data about how and when mobile workers submit forms. Worker activity data can help the organisation understand mobile worker performance and enable program managers to provide supportive supervision. Viewing worker activity data, the organisation can find out things such as </p>

	<ol><li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Which CHW submitted the form</p>
		</li>
		<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">How long it took the CHW to complete the form</p>
		</li>
		<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">When the form was sent to the CommCareHQ server over the mobile data network or Wi-Fi network</p>
		</li>
		<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Whether the form is related to a case and, if so, which one </p>
		</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><p dir="ltr">Dimagi has developed a variety of reports using worker activity data. Collectively, we refer to them as "Worker Activity Reports," and have made them available on CommCare HQ. Across all projects, worker activity reports will be very useful in monitoring workers and providing supportive supervision. These reports can be generated and viewed within CommCare HQ, exported to Excel, or sent via email. Reports available to any organisation include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Case Activity - how frequently does a given mobile worker submit a form related to a given case</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Submissions by Form - which forms are being submitted by a given mobile worker over a time period</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Daily Form Activity - how many forms does a given mobile worker submit over a time period</p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">We are attaching two supporting documents with this application that details the following: </p>

<p dir="ltr">Dimagi possesses good experience of creating and deploying shelf ready applications for public good. Dimagi used CommCare, to develop a suite of template applications for COVID-19 response efforts across several areas like port-of-entry screening, health worker training, and lab testing. Important lessons learned in creating a scalable model include templatizing everything, collaborating early with other Global Goods, and leveraging project investments from different markets. Dimagi’s also had a partnership with Medic Mobile for COVID-19 response.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of some key use cases that can be addressed by this intervention. Please note that all user scenarios and use cases are imaginary and have been presented just to link the user stories to particular activities in the work packages (discussed below) to create a modularised and shelf ready reference application , that can be up and running with minimal configuration, can be used in different ANC scenarios and in different country contexts. The business processes and workflows will be validated with our partner Living Goods through utilising their digital health related experiences in Africa: </p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p dir="ltr"><strong>Use case 1</strong></p>
			 

			<p dir="ltr">Community Health Workers (CHWs) help improve maternal and child health by providing essential healthcare services and driving behavior change at the local level. Their role assumes even greater significance in low and middle-income countries that face an acute shortage of healthcare professionals and account for an overwhelming majority of these preventable deaths. These CHWs are burdened with paperwork, lack the knowledge of internationally recognised protocols of work, decision support for key tasks, target identification and tracking of tasks and thus are not able to improve service delivery capability. Thus a health system faces delay in data collection, obstructing decision making.</p>
			 

			<p dir="ltr"><strong>User story 1</strong></p>
			 

			<p dir="ltr">Mary, a health worker in a remote district in India attends to Alka Devi who is pregnant and has come to the primary health centre for the first time after feeling nauseous. The health centre has no record of her and the attendant takes her name, address, phone number and date of birth into a paper register.  Mary administers a test to confirm Alka Devi’s pregnancy. Upon confirming the positive pregnancy test, Mary proceeds to ask more detailed questions about occupation, behaviors, general health status, obstetric history and support systems. Mary is however not able to not able to conclude the exact gestational age but lets Alka know that she would be needing an ultrasound. While Mary conducts the other checks (blood pressure, height, age etc), she is not sure that she is providing appropriate counselling and action and is not able to inform Alka about all the other tests (diabetes etc). She feels that a digital system with appropriate prompts and reminders would be essential for her to provide prompt and complete service.</p>

Adolescent-friendly services is not yet a familiar concept.Because of the high rate of child marriage, adolescent girls in Bangladesh face risks from early pregnancies, violence and lack in nutrition.There is high fertility rate among adolescents. Bangladeshi adolescents often lack access to health facilities.Adolescents and their families also have very limited awareness of health needs. This includes information on reproductive health, nutrition and psycho-social counselling. These conditions contribute to high mortality rates of newborns in Bangladesh, besides neonatal and maternal morbidities.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Adolescent Fatima comes to the health centre with her mother in law. The registration centre takes note of her date of birth and demographic details through a digital system and sends her to the treatment room where nurse Amira is waiting for her. Amira receives a reminder on her system reminding that Fatima is an adolescent client and the HEADS questions (home, education/activities, employment, drugs) questions need to be asked. After asking a series of non- threatening questions, she asks routine clinical questions, performs a physical examination with consent and checks height, weight, blood pressure and pulse rate. Amira asks her to go through an ultrasound scan as soon as possible and provides tetanus toxoid and iron folic acid tablets. She also asks her to have good food and nutrition and visit the health centre every month for counselling</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Community Feedback</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Dimagi solicits feedback on a regular basis for its work and engages with digital development communities, and organisations to meet to follow the following principles of digital development: </p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Design with the user: One of Dimagi’s core philosophies which it will follow for this project  is “design under the mango tree,” otherwise known as directly collaborating with and learning from local teams. The tactics we use to achieve user centered design are detailed <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/blog/five-design-principles-for-digital-products-in-developing-regions/">here</a> and  include designing locally, going beyond words, building for offline use and testing everything. Living Goods shares this philosophy and uses the same principle in designing its digital tools</p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Understand the existing ecosystem: Data is only as valuable as an organization’s ability to leverage it for progress, thus Dimagi provides and will continue to provide consulting support for the whole digital ecosystem from digital architecture to data collection tools, and analytics to integration. Dimagi has long recognized that no one digital tool sits alone, and we work with technology firms and programmatic stakeholders to define and execute the desired interoperability and integration of digital tools. Dimagi has designed strategies for many of the leading global goods and worked with other technology firms to implement those strategies including OpenLMIS, OpenMRS, DHIS2, iHRIS, and OpenHIE/OpenHIM. We also have worked with tools that include, and are not limited to, Tableau, Power BI, Simprints, Frontline SMS, Telerivet, and Twilio. More information on CommCare’s integrations can be found <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/integrations/">here</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Design for scale: Dimagi has designed CommCare for scale. CommCare is used by close to one million frontline workers around the world, who are cumulatively tracking tens of millions of people and submitting more than 5 million forms a day via the system.CommCare is being used in National Scale Digital projects all over the world. Details can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L7wSzKA-FI38hCLIHmhXE8aM83YAJAXF8OVxf2NUYdQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<ol start="4"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Build for sustainability: We are committed to supporting our implementing partners to ensure that projects are able to sustain themselves beyond the donor funding cycle. Dimagi ensures project sustainability in several key ways. First, as an open source software solution, CommCare does not bind users to a single service provider. Rather, as projects scale, local governments and partners may transfer the application to their own servers, manage the code independently of Dimagi, or add or update features using their own staff or locally contracted service providers. Secondly, in an effort to ensure partner capacity, Dimagi strives to train stakeholders at all levels not only in using CommCare applications, but also in designing, building, maintaining, and troubleshooting them. Drawing on Dimagi's collective experience in what knowledge and skills are required for a project to be sustainable, we create a set of guidelines and educational resources on how to develop CommCare applications, train mobile users, provide technical support, and interpret reports and data for monitoring. </p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="5"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Use Open standards, open source and open innovation: CommCare is an open source software. Dimagi releases its software under the most permissive of Open Source Initiative software licenses (BSD and Apache v 2.0). These licenses grant organizations complete freedom to re-use, redistribute, and reproduce Dimagi's software without consulting Dimagi.Using open source code is especially beneficial if a project is going to scale or if there is a need to transfer the digital health technology to a government. With open source code, governments can directly copy and customize pre-existing code and set-up their own servers without having to pay for licensing fees, use, or distribution of the software. This ensures that local software developers in a country can take ownership of a code base, and can be important for the long-term sustainability of a large-scale mHealth project.</p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="6"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Address Privacy and Security: Dimagi has designed its software and infrastructure to ensure that we can fully maintain the confidentiality and security of our clients’ data. Data collected by Dimagi’s mobile solutions is often sensitive, including protected health information. To best protect this data, Dimagi employs many layers of data security and prioritizes the integrity and safety of data hosted on our system. This is exemplified by our recent SOC-2 certification. </p>
	</li>
</ol><ol start="7"><li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Be Collaborative: Dimagi has recently teamed up with other digital global goods providers, including Medic Mobile and Ona, to develop a shared and open data model for COVID-19 vaccine delivery. By agreeing on a standard data schema now, we can harmonize efforts across platforms, allowing for easier interoperability and collaboration. During our work on the Precision Tasking Application which was supported by Digital Square, we coordinated and solicited feedback from ONA and Medic.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px">Please find the answers to the questions you have posed.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Warmly</p>

<p dir="ltr">Prateep Chakraborty </p>

<p dir="ltr"> </p>

<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>1. How will the applications align to the principles of shelf-readiness, as proposed in the concept note</strong></span></h1>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Through this proposal, Dimagi will build “template applications” that can be used as fully-functioning applications within a desktop or mobile browser and as standalone, offline-capable Android applications. These applications can be customized, but no customization is needed to start using them immediately. Because Dimagi maintains a secure cloud server, organizations do not have to precure servers or any other infrastructure to use them immediately. </p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">As an example, Dimagi built and offered free hosting for a variety of template applications for COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.dimagi.com/blog/covid-19-response-template-apps/">https://www.dimagi.com/blog/covid-19-response-template-apps/</a>) to help organizations  carry out disease surveillance and educational activities based on leading clinical protocols from the World Health Organization, CDC, and others. These web and mobile based applications can be used immediately.  The template applications included ones for:  </p>

<ul><li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Contact Tracing: WHO First Few X (FFX) Cases</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Facility readiness and stock tracking</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Health care provider training and monitoring</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Port of entry surveillance</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Home based care</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Covid-19 RDT collection</p>
	</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">These template applications were downloaded thousands of times. </p>

<p class="rtejustify">Having stated the above , CommCare does allow organizations to quickly build custom solutions without compromising the unique needs of a field team. Additionally, CommCare provides a turn-key system that enables non-developers to quickly build mobile applications and SMS interactions and workflows. This enables CommCare to meet aggressive timelines and provides the benefit of allowing very fast iteration on the user experience.</p>

<h1 class="rtejustify" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>2. Please expand on how and what standards for data exchange will be used and adopted</strong></span></h1>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Health information systems often need to be able to communicate with one another and share data back and forth in a secure, reliable way.  Having an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system can be critical for effective healthcare delivery. And streamlining such systems to efficiently communicate and compile information across multiple platforms can take the efficacy and quality of that healthcare delivery to a new level.</p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a popular way to standardize the format in which data is shared by outlining consistent data elements and providing an API for sharing electronic health records.</p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Because workflows in CommCare frequently involve the collection of healthcare data and often require integration with other governmental or private sector systems, Dimagi is committed to building turnkey integrations compliant to FHIR standards. To that end, Dimagi has recently collaborated with PATH and Digital Square to ensure that CommCare is FHIR interoperable and can integrate either directly with FHIR or through an OpenHIE mediator.</p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Being FHIR compliant, allows CommCareHQ to be interoperable with all FHIR compliant systems and facilitate quick and easy integrations.Currently CommCareHQ supports the v4.0.1 or R4 FHIR specification. Please refer to more details <a href="https://readthedocs.org/projects/commcare-hq/downloads/pdf/latest/">here</a> (<a href="https://readthedocs.org/projects/commcare-hq/downloads/pdf/latest/">CommCareHQ Documentation (readthedocs.org)</a></p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">The supported FHIR Resource Types:</p>

<ol><li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Patient</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Observation</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">DiagnosticReport</p>
	</li>
</ol><p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr"><strong>CommCare and FHIR standards</strong></p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">CommCare’s turnkey integration with FHIR standards, including an OpenHIE mediator, significantly reduces the level of effort required to support data interoperability with other systems. This means more programs will benefit from access to job aid and data collection programs based on CommCare, and administrators will be able to spend more time actually reviewing the data they collect, rather than cleaning and merging manually.</p>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">CommCare simply displays a UI in which variables outlined in CommCare HQ are mapped to FHIR resource properties, allowing the FHIR API to accurately forward and pull data. Once those variables are properly mapped, any update to data in CommCare triggers an update to be sent to the FHIR server, already configured to map directly to those standardized variables.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Additional Data exchange capabilities for CommCare</strong></span></h1>

<p class="rtejustify" dir="ltr">Beyond these standard based communications, CommCare is used by 2000+ international development projects across 300+ partners in 80+ countries to transform their last-mile data collection and service delivery practices. These organizations not only get value from CommCare’s powerful native capabilities, but also from our entire ecosystem of integrations with their favorite products and services. Here is what the CommCare integration and exchange of data looks like: </p>
