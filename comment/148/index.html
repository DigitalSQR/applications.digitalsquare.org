<div class="field field-name-field-executive-summary field-type-text-long field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Executive summary:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Accenture LLP and Jhpiego are pleased to submit this final application to express our interest in exploring the extent to which digital financial services (“DFS”) in low-resource settings have contributed to increased financial protection, increased demand and use of health services, and ultimately improved health systems performance. The consortium, which combines Accenture’s global consulting experience and innovation capabilities with Jhpiego’s intimate knowledge and experience in the global health context (including digital health, health financing, digital financial services, access to essential services, and health service responsiveness) would bring a well-positioned perspective to help PATH and Digital Square build on United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) encouraging early research which has deepened the global understanding around benefits, challenges, and impact of DFS in health. This final application highlights the global expertise that Accenture and Jhpiego would bring to this engagement, including:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Deep global health and health system strengthening experience</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Accenture has worked with INGOs, donors, foundations, corporates, multilaterals and governments on 250+ global health initiatives to deliver sustainable impact.</strong>  We work extensively to strengthen our clients’ programmatic portfolios, enabled by enterprise operations and systems.  We draw on the specialization of Accenture’s 20,000+ healthcare industry professionals and 1,000+ international development professionals serving over 70 developing countries. We help our clients in emerging markets by offering strategy support to identify and capitalize on market trends, design and implement digital strategies, and develop effective and scalable programs. Accenture worked on a health system strengthening project in collaboration with the Aurum Project and the CDC. The project provided technical assistance on the development of the National Health Planning framework in the planning directorate of the National Department of Health (NDoH). The planning framework aimed to strengthen District Planning and Monitoring at the NDoH in order to improve service delivery and deliver better outcomes at the district and provincial level.</p>

<p><strong>Jhpiego motivates health care providers to record and use service delivery data as an integrated component of training to improve responsiveness and quality of service delivery promoting a more client-centered approach.</strong> Accurate recordkeeping is important not only to health system strengthening, but also to scaling up high-impact interventions for quality health services. Jhpiego has provided in-service training courses on the importance of recordkeeping, development of tools, and application of data for program and quality improvement. In countries such as Tanzania and Nigeria, Jhpiego has integrated Malaria in Pregnancy (MIP) control and treatment components with ANC and RH services, working with governments to provide technical assistance to strengthen M&amp;E capacity to capture the progress and challenges of integrated health programming. In Lesotho, Malawi and Tanzania, Jhpiego developed the current data collection tools for VMMC that have been adopted by the MOH and integrated into the national HMIS system. The 2013 report, Strengthening Health Management Information Systems for Maternal and Child Health: Documenting MCHIP’s Contributions, summarizes how the Jhpiego-led MCHIP contributed to improving global and local data management, data quality assessments. Also highlighted is MCHIP’s work in seven countries to strengthen data flow and aggregation for both facility- and community-based programs and built the capacity of health care workers in these countries to use HMIS tools correctly and consistently. MCHIP facilitated the use of information products that enable quick visualization of data such as service delivery trends posters and scorecards in 12 countries, leading to routine use of data for program monitoring and planning. These tools can lead to quicker action, increased accountability, and revitalization of commitments to improve health outcomes.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Strong digital financial inclusion experience and applications in health and beyond</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Accenture works with several commercial and NGO financial service organizations to promote the economic inclusion of low-income populations, particularly those that cut across and beyond the health. </strong>We leverage our digital capabilities to help clients remain at the forefront of emerging technologies, increase their reach and scale through innovative digital and mobile solutions, and amplify their impact through data and analytics. For example, we worked with Mastercard to identify innovative applications of their digital payment solutions throughout healthcare value chains in underserved communities, while with the Grameen Foundation in India, we leveraged artificial intelligence to develop a multilingual virtual financial advisor to empower skilled field agents and drive financial inclusion in underserved regions.</p>

<p><strong>Over the decades, Jhpiego has integrated cutting edge digital health tools into our work, recognizing the power and benefit of technology to improve quality of care, affect health outcomes, and empower health workers to make complex decisions.</strong> Under the USAID-funded MAISHA project, Jhpiego collaborated with D-tree International in Tanzania on the mHealth for Safer Deliveries initiative, which incorporated a mobile decision-making application with a mobile money component for CHWs. Phones were equipped with an open source decision-support application and an EzyPesa (mobile banking) account. The tools included forms for registration of pregnant women, prior permission of decision-makers for transport, screening for danger signs at all phases, referral forms, and postnatal follow-up forms. In addition, the application allowed for registration of health facility contacts, transport provider contacts, and pre-negotiated transport rates.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital and health landscaping experience in LMICs</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Accenture has carried out numerous technology and digital landscape assessments for development sector clients to inform information systems &amp; digital strategies.</strong>  For instance, we worked with Amref Health Africa on an mHealth innovation market landscape and developed the strategy, design and implementation of their mobile Community Health Worker training platform that has allowed for the training of over 35,000 community health workers. We also delivered an mHealth technology strategy for Living Goods (LG), where we developed a global mHealth technology landscape assessment for Sub Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and provided recommendations for partnership based on LG’s level of technology maturity and potential partner capabilities. More, Accenture helped Philips to assess the economic and social potential for a new infant resuscitation technology across Africa, first through a wide secondary research effort, followed by deep-dive assessments in two markets. And finally, we supported PATH’s Digital Square efforts in South Africa to conduct a detailed landscape assessments of national partner management and community focused information systems.</p>

<p><strong>Jhpiego seeks to achieve positive health outcomes in the most effective and efficient manner possible, putting the patient at the center of each intervention.</strong> Jhpiego leads with the health objective, not the technology. We seek to first understand and identify the health problem to be solved and the assets that can be leveraged, the context and environment as well as constraints and enabling factors, and then determine the contribution digital health can make and the most appropriate digital health solution. From as early as 1987, when Jhpiego introduced computer-assisted instruction to simulate clinical situations in several of its US-based courses, to the internet boom in 1995 when Jhpiego launched ReproLine, an online source for reproductive health information, to the mobile revolution with point-of-care and decision support tools for health workers on personal digital assistants, smartphones and tablets, digital health has been an integral part of Jhpiego’s approach to development.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Our long-standing relationships with PATH and USAID</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Accenture has built a trusted relationship with PATH for nearly a decade across all parts of the organization. </strong>In 2010, Accenture first worked with PATH to develop an overall finance IT strategy and vision to show how investments in business process and information technology will support finance operations in the future –improving operational excellence, accountability, and continued growth.  Accenture also helped to develop a donor engagement strategy for PATH’s Global Health Innovation Hub, enabling PATH to continue its strategic and focused approach to fundraising.  Additionally, we partnered with PATH, Pfizer, Gavi and the Ministry of Health to pilot an open source 2D barcoding tool for serialized and secure supply chains in Nicaragua, with discussions on expansion in Gambia. We also partnered with PATH, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID and 25+ cross sector organizations to create a control tower blueprint (The Visibility &amp; Analytics Network) to bring leading supply chain visibility and analytics to the African public sector, starting with South Africa. We are excited to continue our strong relationship with PATH to contribute to the vision of improving the health of more than 400 million people by 2030.</p>

<p><strong>Jhpiego currently implements 108 awards from various donors, including USAID.</strong> In addition to the USAID-funded MAISHA project in Tanzania, Jhpiego has led USAID’s flagship MNCH/FP/RH projects, including MCSP, demonstrating the expertise and experience required to seamlessly manage small and large programs with multiple core and field investments in 32 countries. Jhpiego is a proven and trusted implementing partner with a strong record of delivering results, in addition to having strong implementation science and research capabilities and systems.</p>

<ul><li><strong>ADP’s unique, low cost sustainable consulting model</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>ADP represents a unique model where Accenture employees from across the globe are seconded to work on high-impact projects that benefit the development sector, at a reduced rate from Accenture’s commercial rates.</strong> Through our ADP practice, we have delivered over 1,400 high-impact projects that are focused on strengthening and improving the effectiveness of development sector organizations, as well as how business and technology experience can be leveraged to address key international development issues, such as health, education, disaster recovery, agriculture, urban development, energy, financial inclusion, fostering private sector development, and promoting innovation. </p>

<p><strong>Digital Financial Services on Health Outcomes and Health Systems </strong></p>

<p><strong>General comments and observations submitted by Walter Brown: </strong><a href="mailto:walter@sakan.org.za"><strong>walter@sakan.org.za.</strong></a><strong>  This comment applies to all applications.</strong></p>

<p>The Digital Financial Services on Health Outcomes and Health Systems funded by USAID in this Request for Application #2019-20 is most welcome, timely, and urgent: implementation of the research results will most definitely ease the plight of many low-income individuals and groups to better manage their health service needs.</p>

<p>But, based on analyses of all Sustainable Development Challenges focused on South Africa, a leading African continental economic giant, and the global leader in income inequalities, unemployment, and inadequate national educational outcomes, there remains a vast population of global citizens that remain excluded from the benefits of this and numerous other global initiatives aimed at resolving all SDG challenges through ICT by year 2030. These are the global citizens who cannot afford ANY digital services, financial or otherwise, to help them to overcome ANY of the SDG challenges, especially SDG3 – Health and Wellbeing, which this DFS programme seeks to address.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is skewed heavily against sub-Sahara Africa:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li>World poverty levels, measured as the proportion of global citizens surviving below the World Bank defined poverty line of US$1.90 PPP per day, have steadily declined from 35.9% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. At the “Upper-Middle-Income” economic group poverty line of US$5.50 PPP, the ratio rises to 46.1%.</li>
	<li>Two regions, East Asia and Pacific (47 million extreme poor – <strong><em>2.3% in 2015</em></strong>) and Europe and Central Asia (7 million – <strong><em>1.5% in 2015</em></strong>) have reduced extreme poverty to below 3 percent, achieving the 2030 target. At the Upper-Middle-Income level of US$5.5, this rises to 34.8% for the whole Asia/Pacific region.</li>
	<li>Europe and Central Asia: 1.5% at US$1.90 PPP: 14% at US$5.50 PPP.</li>
	<li>Latin America and the Caribbean: 3.9% at US$1.90 PPP; 26.3% at US$5.50 PPP.</li>
	<li>More than half of the extreme poor live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, the number of poor in the region increased by 9 million, with 413 million people living on less than US$1.90 a day in 2015 (<strong><em>41.1% of the total population of 969 million in 2015</em></strong>), more than all the other regions combined. If the trend continues, by 2030, nearly 9 out of 10 extreme poor will be in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty ratios at US$1.90 and US$5.50 are <strong>41.4% and 85%</strong> respectively.</li>
	<li>In South Africa, the continental economic leader, the equivalent ratios are 18.9% at the US$1.90 PPP poverty line, but as an Upper-Middle-Income economy, the applicable poverty line is US$5.50 PPP, the ratio is 57.1%. This latter poverty line is equivalent to the nation's own upper-bound poverty line.</li>
</ol><p>Does this mean that 57.1% of South Africa’s citizens are excluded from the full benefits of the DFS initiative?</p>

<p>What of the remaining sub-Sahara African (SSA) countries, especially those in the SADC region, which is the epicenter of poverty as reflected by the proportion of Least Developed Countries (LDC)? Are 85% of this population group excluded from the DSF initiative? The few SSA countries included in the current phase of the DSF initiative are welcome inclusions, but the comments above are very relevant to their unique situations.</p>

<p>Note: Data sources: <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview">https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview</a> - Last Updated: Oct 02, 2019; AND World Bank Poverty Data (updated 28 October 2019): <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty">https://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty</a>.</p>

<p>The “pleas and/or requests” emanating from this comment are three-fold:</p>

<ol><li>How can the DSF initiative be expanded, now or in the future, to address the multidimensional SDG challenges of the 41.4% of Africans who survive at less than US$1.90 per day, too little to meet their daily food needs, let alone their health service needs?</li>
</ol><p>In the context of South Africa, several “conversations” are at an early stage, including with the financial services sector, see e.g. the “<a href="https://www.sakan.org.za/Docs/Financial Services SDG Talking Points August 2019_handout.pdf">Financial Services and SDG Talking Points</a>”, and the more detailed submission to the “<a href="http://www.compcom.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Walter-Brown.pdf">Competition Commission’s Data Services Market Inquiry</a>”, both are available for download via the hyperlinks provided, and the latter will launch its final report this coming first week of December 2019.</p>

<ol><li>In the introduction of the DSF initiative, USAID underscores the importance of a holistic approach to programming. This is extremely complex as discussed in the draft document <a href="https://www.sakan.org.za/Docs/ICT4SDG.pdf">https://www.sakan.org.za/Docs/ICT4SDG.pdf</a>. Is it possible for USAID to consider using its global influence to contribute towards the coordination of the numerous “silo” interventions being funded by equally numerous public and private development agencies, including the “<a href="https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/challenge/innovations-improving-impact-health-campaigns-round-24">Innovations for Improving the Impact of Health Campaigns</a>” by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation?</li>
	<li>Can all bidders to this DSF initiative please consider the plight of those who have too little to participate in any financial services, as part of their continuing interventions in poverty alleviation and social exclusion, as part of this DSF initiative and beyond? How can we best share this information globally, and set up global partnerships for the purpose, given the global nature of the SDG challenges?</li>
