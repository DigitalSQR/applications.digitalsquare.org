<div class="field field-name-field-two-sentence-overview field-type-text-long field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Two-sentence overview:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>This project seeks to improve several key areas of Sant√©MPI, a robust and proven online/offline capable Client Registry (CR) solution with a rich global history, to strengthen the ability of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) to adopt, sustain, evolve and scale this technology as a global good by: improving installation and configuration processes including localization, enhancing tooling for end-users to more easily customize deployments, upgrading standards support from FHIR R3 to R4, improving operational support through analytics and expanding community documentation.</p>

<p><br />
Our organization and partners will contribute to achieving these goals by leveraging and applying decades of deep expertise and experience in open source digital health software including: software innovation, development, large-scale implementation, support and capacity building; development and use of open standards such as FHIR, IHE and OpenHIE; along with our in-depth experience developing and implementing the original MEDIC CR solution and evolving it into the next generation Sant√©MPI CR.<br />
¬†</p>
</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-executive-summary field-type-text-long field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Executive summary:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Siloed digital health solutions implementing multiple patient identifiers (IDs) create significant barriers in LMICs to operationalizing strategies for achieving universal health coverage (UHC) including enabling holistic person-centered care, reducing the burden of indicator reporting on frontline health workers, improving the accuracy and timeliness of data, and establishing integrated, national digital health ecosystems. Sant√©MPI supports migration from paper based to fully automated workflows providing a pathway to implementing and achieving UHC.</p>

<p><br />
A proven, robust, fully featured Master Patient Index (MPI) and Client Registry (CR) like Sant√©MPI is a strategic digital health building block which can be used to overcome these obstacles to data quality, harmonization and sharing, by acting as a cornerstone technology when implementing national health identifiers. Sant√©MPI implements all existing interoperable specifications and requirements related to Client Registry in the OpenHIE specification and supports Client Registry as a service. By implementing both modern HL7 FHIR standards and the widely deployed existing legacy HL7v2 standards, Sant√©MPI provides a proven platform for integrating existing solutions and future solutions. For example, Sant√©MPI integrates with WorldVistA EHR, OpenMRS and OSCAR EMR. Sant√©MPI has been field tested with millions of successful transactions in multiple jurisdictions and can operate standalone or as a launching point into a health information exchange.</p>

<p><br />
The overall goal of this project is to enhance Sant√©MPI to become a reusable digital global good. This will enable LMICs to rapidly adopt and sustain Sant√©MPI at scale and will be achieved by improving key areas of this next generation online/offline capable MPI/CR solution. Sant√©MPI is a commercially supported open source derivative of the MEDIC Client Registry (CR) which was developed in a Canadian federally supported applied research centre to enable the Canadian national digital health program. The core MEDIC CR product development began in 2007 and since then has been expanded and hardened through millions of dollars of investment from public, NGO and private sector initiatives. MEDIC CR is a standards compliant Patient Identity System used as the reference implementation in the Canadian standards testing lab and has passed IHE North America Connectathon testing. The Sant√©MPI team is the original development team behind MEDIC CR, leveraging over 10 years of investment and experience developing and implementing MEDIC CR, including several deployments at regional and national scale, including national deployments in South-east Asia and Africa. Sant√©Suite Inc. offers development, deployment and support services for this next generation of MEDIC CR.¬†</p>

<p><br />
Funding from this award will go toward software infrastructure improvements, upgrading existing interoperability standards capabilities, upgrading tooling used for integration, administration and testing and engaging stakeholders and the OpenHIE Client Registry community to refine deliverables and specifications. Key activities will include improving installation and configuration processes, enhancing tooling for end-users to customize deployments, upgrading standards support more easily from FHIR R3 to R4, and expanding, enriching community technical and policy documentation and creating a live sandbox testing environment to rapidly demonstrate and test Client Registry functionality.</p>

<p><br />
Sant√©Suite will achieve the goals of this project by applying its team‚Äôs extensive experience in designing, developing and implementing MPI/CR and EMR solutions at national scale in LMICs; operationalizing interoperability standards; building local capacity through hands-on teaching, teaming and tooling; and co-creating digital health strategy, policy and operating procedures.<br />

(SSI), a Canadian federally incorporated social benefits corporation and Hamilton Health Sciences/McMaster University Medical Centre, the second largest academic research hospital in Canada, a pioneer in evidence-based medicine and a globally recognized health innovator.¬†</p>

<p><br /><strong>Sant√©Suite Inc. ‚Äì Prime Organization</strong></p>

<p>The main proponent of this proposal is Sant√©Suite Inc (SSI), one of the world‚Äôs most experienced teams in global digital health research, development and implementation. SSI is a social benefits corporation (B Corp status pending) made up of passionate, broadly experienced people committed to improving the health of the world using digital technology. The directors of SSI are the original proven team that developed the MEDIC CR platform and completed several implementations of national scale MPI technology. The following is a summary of SSI‚Äôs team and key personnel‚Äôs experience.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Sant√©Suite Inc. Team Experience</strong><br />
The Sant√©Suite team is one of the worlds most advanced teams in digital health standards, specifically relating to Client Registry/Master Patient Index, combining decades of research, development and real-world implementation experience around the globe. Members of Sant√©Suite assisted in the authoring of the underlying HL7 and IHE standards that are used as the basis for the OpenHIE Client Registry specification. Our team were early contributors to HL7 FHIR and even implemented and released the first iOS reference implementation of FHIR. Our team has made significant contributions to the IHE community as well, authoring enhancements to the IHE PIX and PDQ standards, including leading the authoring of the first version of the mobile version of those profiles (PIXm and PDQm). Members of our team have participated in IHE Connectathons for decades, including supporting the interoperability showcases at the HIMSS conference and the Canadian eHealth conference as interoperability leaders. Members of our team were involved in establishing the first FHIR Connectathons and hosted the national FHIR Connectathons for Canada (‚ÄúFHIR North‚Äù).</p>

<p><br />
The Sant√©Suite team was formed to bring together the collective experiences of several experienced digital health professionals. Combined, the founding members of Sant√©Suite bring over 50 years of digital health systems development and deployment experience. National deployments in Canada, Jordan, Tanzania, Southeast Asia have seen millions of patients cared for through leveraging solutions deployed by the Sant√©Suite team members. Sant√©MPI is currently in the first phase of national deployment to support Myanmar‚Äôs Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) national digital health roadmap, which complies with the OpenHIE architecture. The first wave of integration is focused on providing a cloud based and distributed MPI/CR service linking over 120 OpenMRS HIV/TB instances. This national MPI/CR initiative is funded by the Global fund through UNOPS and UNAIDS, with the participation of all key development partners that are active in building the digital health ecosystem. Additionally, the founding members of Sant√©Suite have demonstrated skill in the design, implementation and maintenance of proven digital global goods and open source solutions including: the Everest Framework, which has enabled dozens of other software projects to implement HL7 standards; the MEDIC CR, leveraged as the basis of CR in Ontario‚Äôs Innovation Lab and Tanzania; OpenIZ, assisting with the immunization of millions of patients in east Africa; Sant√©MPI, linking HIV and TB programmes in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p><br />
The Sant√©Suite team is composed of several members of the original team that developed the MEDIC Client Registry as well as the OpenIZ national scale immunization solution. This project involved several complex requirements to be able to support better health outcomes for the citizens of the United Republic of Tanzania with the Ministry of Health in Tanzania, PATH, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. From a technical architecture standpoint, the system has been designed to perform at a national scale. The development of the Tanzania project started in May of 2016 and rollout began in mid-2017 to various regions. The solution now stores data for 1 million patients, 5 million vaccination records, and is in use within over 2000 clinics with more clinics being on-boarded each day. MEDIC CR provides the MPI functionality for this national scale solution.</p>

<p><br />
Key members of the Sant√©Suite team have also participated as the lead developer of the provincial immunization solution for the Ministry of Health in Province of Ontario, Canada, a solution for tracking the immunization progress of nearly 14 million patients.</p>

</ul><p>To clarify, Tanzania is using the same underlying CDR/DB as SanteMPI as part of the underlying TiMR EIR platform which is nationally deployed. In addition SanteMPI is currenly in the first phase of a national deployment initiative, in a country in South East Asia. Please see Concept Note for futher details.</p>

<ul><li>What are the client matching algorithms/features that exist and what need to be developed?¬†</li>
</ul><p>The current matching engine supports blocking records against the database then scoring each result against a configured series of attributes, classifying them as match, probable match and non match. This is then used by the MDM engine to link local records to a master record (which can further be adjudicated to a record of truth).<br />
Individual attributes can be matched on: levenshtein difference, soundex, metaphone, double metaphone, alias/synonyms (i.e. Will = Bill), and date differences.</p>

<p>Partial scoring of each resulting match vector is also supported using distance.</p>

<ul><li>What are some of the risks?</li>
</ul><p>Please see the Concept Paper for a description of risks and their mitigation.</p>
