Project Balance proposes to develop “Mobile Facility Mapper”, an intuitive, user friendly mobile application that collects crowdsourced facility location and services information by integrating with Open Street Map and Resource Map OpenHIE. Often GPS devices and GIS tools are technical in nature and difficult for non-technical individuals to implement. This application will provide a quick and easy method of capturing health facility information including GPS location, services provided, affiliation, and other meta data, both for public and official consumption. Should the user have suitable access to a national Resource Map OpenHIE registry, they can integrate and update to the national registry with relevant information about the facility.  National health ministries and their partners will be empowered with crowdsourced data made available by health professionals from all spheres including donors, partners and national ministry staff.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>2) Consortium Team: </strong></p><p><strong>a)      </strong><strong>Profile of organization’s relevant qualifications</strong></p><p><strong>Project Balance (project lead)</strong> is a small woman-owned company with extensive experience working in low resources settings in Africa and the Caribbean. Our team develops and deploys healthcare, agriculture and social welfare mobile and PC applications to collect and report on data funded by USAID, CDC and other international programs. Our expertise with open source technology tools and developing solutions that address real needs are the ingredients required to bring tangible tools and capabilities to communities in need.</p><p> </p><p>Project Balance excels at project implementation. Our adaptive management and interactive approach optimize the team’s skills and keeps the team focused on delivering quality products and services. Our staff has complementary experience in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) and Information, Communications, and Technology. We provide leadership in management, monitoring and evaluation, and organizational support to improve how data is collected, managed and used. To increase data use, Project Balance develops innovative software products that incorporate data quality measures, intuitive user interface design, and solutions that meet the stakeholder requirements. We have successfully directed multi-million, large-scale, multinational, and offshore projects.</p><p> </p><p><strong>InSTEDD </strong><strong>(technical collaborator)</strong> is a US-based non-profit organization (501.c.3) that designs and uses open source technology to help partners enhance collaboration and improve information flow and knowledge sharing, to better deliver critical services to vulnerable populations. InSTEDD is committed to the user-centered design, agile software development, and building local capacity to use technology for social good. InSTEDD is a founding member and leader of OpenHIE, and a recognized leader in the effective design and development of open source solutions related to GIS, mobile, and lab diagnostic solutions for global health challenges.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAI (end-user stakeholder-Haiti)</strong> is an international development organization that tackles fundamental social and economic development problems caused by inefficient markets, ineffective governance, and instability. We work with a wide range of clients, including national and local governments, bilateral and multilateral donors, private corporations, and philanthropies. DAI’s Haiti HIS team, works closely with the Haitian Ministry of Health to consolidate and integrate Haiti’s disconnected health information assets. The team has both technical and non-technical who will give end-user feedback and help test the proposed application in the field.</p><p> </p><p><strong>b)      </strong><strong>Profile of relevant experience and examples of related work</strong></p><p>As a contractor to DAI (2017-Present) on the USAID Haiti national HIS project (2017-present), Project Balance is assisting DAI in managing the country’s two national instances of DHIS2 with up to 1600 data elements collected monthly from over 800 facilities across all 10 Departments in Haiti.  DAI and Project Balance have worked closely with USAID, the MOH and country stakeholders to manage version upgrades, data cleaning, data harmonization as well as implementation of the DHIS2 Tracker system for patient management.  Project Balance led a smooth transition from the prior DHIS2 system management team to DAI, working through 10 DHIS2 version updates, major server operating system updates and detailed testing.  In addition, Project Balance deployed a public key infrastructure (PKI) system on the public facing servers to secure traffic with TLS and developed and implemented a comprehensive, semi-automated disaster recovery process for the system including a full daily off-site backup of all systems.</p><p> </p><p>Project Balance consulted on AIDSRelief Transition (2011-2016) to provide technical assistance for monitoring and evaluation of the HIV care and treatment program. Our staff worked with Palladium’s Strategic Information team to monitor project performance, provide quality assurance of monthly, semi-annual and ad hoc program reports including the PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation and Reports (MER) and identify ways to improve how data is used to inform program planning. There was a significant focus on monitoring and evaluation of the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) Option B+ model, community-based care and treatment models, and child and adolescent care and treatment. Project Balance was responsible for gathering requirements, business analysis, and managing the development of a ‘real-time’ geographic spatial information system to track PMTCT Option B+ services, pharmaceuticals and other commodities. This application and dashboard interfaces with JSI’s commodity tracking system and allows facilities to report stock levels and early prevention indicators. The interactive dashboard provides key stakeholders including the Ministry of Health (MOH) with indicators targeted at early prevention and interventions to improve patient and program outcomes.</p><p> </p><p>Project Balance was instrumental in managing the development of the SCA application for android tablets (mSCA) under the SIDALE project (2011-2014). The mSCA was developed on a tablet for both routine program monitoring and supporting the long-term sustainability of local facilities. Results from the SCA provide a clear picture of the healthcare site’s needs across clinical, strategic information, and management and finance areas, and allows facilities to prioritize technical assistance with greater emphasis given to low-scoring areas that require more attention. The mobile application allows program managers to conduct the SCA and review results in real-time on their tablet or phone while at the facility. This facilitates the development of action plans immediately following the assessments in order to address challenges and reduce barriers to quality services. mSCA works in online-offline modes to ensure usability at remote and unconnected facilities</p><p> </p><p>Project Balance, with The Palladium Group (2013), consulted on the Clinton Health Access Institute’s facility services map visualization for Zambia (Zambia Health Access Tool). This tool displayed all of the Zambia’s health facilities on a map and allowed users to filter the map meta data to find different hospital types/levels, the entity that managed the facility and the services provided such as ART, PMTCT, EID and CD4 testing. This map was used by the ministry of health to determine gaps in service and future expected catchment areas. Because the map provided a lot of different types of data, usability of the filtering and section features as well as color coding was very important to facilitate understanding the end filtered selections.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>c)       </strong><strong>Qualifications of key members of the proposed project team</strong></p><table width="0" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="126"><p><strong>Team Member</strong></p></td><td valign="top" width="288"><p><strong>Role</strong></p></td><td valign="top" width="210"><p><strong>Organization</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="126"><p>Edward Robinson*</p></td><td valign="top" width="288"><p>Technical team lead, Software Architect</p></td><td valign="top" width="210"><p>Project Balance, South Africa</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="126"><p>Michael Lu</p></td><td valign="top" width="288"><p>Mobile application developer</p></td><td valign="top" width="210"><p>Project Balance, South Africa</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="126"><p>Kanchan Verma</p></td><td valign="top" width="288"><p>Senior software tester</p></td><td valign="top" width="210"><p>Project Balance, India</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="126"><p>Lanette Burrows*</p></td><td valign="top" width="288"><p>Project manager, public health expert</p></td><td valign="top" width="210"><p>Project Balance, United States</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="126"><p>Scott Teesdale</p></td><td valign="top" width="288"><p>Consult on Resource Map application.

A master facility list is an essential part of any health management information system, disease surveillance system and supply chain management system. [<a title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Lanette/Dropbox/PB-Proposals/Digital Sqare - Global Goods/DigitalSquare_FullProposalOutline.docx#_ftn2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><sup>,<a title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Lanette/Dropbox/PB-Proposals/Digital Sqare - Global Goods/DigitalSquare_FullProposalOutline.docx#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></sup>]</p><p> </p><p>Open Street Map is the 'Wikipedia' of maps.  It is an open access, crowdsourced spatial database available to everyone. It is particularly popular with humanitarian and international development organizations where it has been used to record, update and present spatial data in a variety of ways including crisis response such as during the 2010 Haiti earthquake (<a href="https://bit.ly/2JwkomY">https://bit.ly/2JwkomY</a>). Furthermore, projects such as 'Missing Maps' (missingmap.org) use Open Street Map to pre-emptively map places around the world where the most vulnerable people live in anticipation of crises.  Due to the open nature, valuable data can be crowdsourced and made available to anyone requiring it in real time.</p><p>OpenHIE (<a href="https://ohie.org/">https://ohie.org/</a>) is a free, open, standards-based health interoperability platform which includes a scalable facility registry module, allowing the collection, curation and storage of standardized, up-to-date health facility and resource data at country level.  Resource Map (<a href="http://resourcemap.instedd.org/">http://resourcemap.instedd.org</a>), developed by inSTEDD, is the latest implementation of the OpenHIE facility registry reference application and has the advantage of being generic and able to record more than just health facility entries.  It also has a free online portal hosted by inSTEDD that allows anyone to adopt the product without hosting costs.  Although our focus for this project will be mainly health facility related, Resource Map can be implemented in other sectors including agriculture, education, social services, etc.  We envisage that the mobile application we are proposing can easily be adapted and redeployed for other sectors in future.</p><p><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">a)      </strong><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">Technical approach to the issue and anticipated outcomes</strong></p><p>Project Balance proposes to develop an intuitive, user friendly mobile application that collects crowdsourced facility information and integrates with Open Street Map and Resource Map, “Mobile Facility Mapper” (MFM). MFM will provide a quick and easy method to capture critical health facility information including GPS location, services provided, affiliation, etc. both for public and official consumption.  The main focus of this application is speed and ease of use which we believe will encourage uptake and use.  Users can be casual users who simply want to identify a facility on the map or they could be local or international professionals who want to capture more in-depth details about the facility for public or professional consumption.</p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Although we envisage the main users (data producers) to be health professionals from national ministries, partners and donors, the application will be available to the general public in the Google Play store and the Apple App store to allow anyone to consume the data using the mobile application.  The proposed application will allow for easy capture of health facility location data by import or capture of a geotagged photograph on the user's smartphone.  The user can capture additional data such as services provided, affiliation data, contact information, etc.  Basic facility information is then uploaded to Open Street Map and made available to anyone for use in the various Open Street Map applications including the public web and mobile apps or in other existing applications via the Open Street Map API.  Users will also be able to update existing facilities if changes to existing records are required – e.g. the facility has closed or no longer provides a certain service.</span></p><div><img src="../sites/default/files/u49/pic1/index.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></div><div> </div><div><p>Should the user have suitable access to a national Resource Map registry, they can integrate the update to the national registry with relevant information about the facility.  This way, national health ministries will be empowered with crowdsourced data made available by health professionals from all spheres including donors, partners and national ministry staff.  The system can be configured to hold uploaded data in a staging database while data curators verify and approve its integration.  In addition to a national master facility list, Resource Map may be implemented individually by partner organizations with suitable capacity who want to store more granular detail than the national master facility list provides.  They may opt to feed their list of facilities from the master facility list while adding facility details not present in the master facility list.</p><p>The system would be available to use as a standalone Open Street Map integrated application or as both Open Street Map and (one or more) Resource Map facility lists.</p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Countries that lack Master Facility Lists can easily implement Resource Map and have staff capture facility data as they travel to sites using the mobile application.  We expect that availability of a mobile application that is both easy to use and integrates with the master facility list will encourage uptake of software such as Resource Map / OpenHIE in countries where no MFL exists.  Those that have existing Master Facility Lists using other database tools have the option of implementing Resource Map and exporting crowdsourced data from Resource Map to their existing systems.</span></p><p><img src="../sites/default/files/u49/pic2/index.png" alt="" width="800" height="415" /></p><p>The application will also be useful to local residents and health care workers to search for and locate facilities by service or other category for consultation, admission or referral.  The data generated can also be used in decision making by national or partner teams when designing interventions and distribution of services. We propose the application architecture and code base be designed and developed as an open source and flexible system, easy to adapt to other public or private sector industries such as education, agriculture and social services.</p><p> </p><p>We envision that the system will have a discovery service that would, based on the user’s location, query a list of countries (maintained by the OpenHIE community) that have publicly available OpenHIE master facility lists and allow the user to incorporate the MFL data for search and as a layer on their map.  They would be able to find facilities based on the specific properties set up in the country-specific MFL (e.g. location, services, etc.).</p><p> </p><p>We propose developing the system using a cross-platform development framework to reduce coding effort and maximize potential by releasing the application on both the iOS and Android platforms.  We anticipate that a significant percentage of the contributors from foreign funded organisations may use iPhones or iPads and we did not want them excluded.  We have investigated existing applications and platforms for suitability including ODK based systems and existing open source mobile based OpenStreetMap applications:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android</a></p><p><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple_iOS">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple_iOS</a></p><p> </p><p>ODK has not been coded for iOS and would therefore require significant effort to use for this project and it is for this reason, ODK has not been chosen as the framework of choice. While ODK would provide useful building blocks for the data capture portion of the application, ODK has not been coded for iOS and would therefore require significant effort to use for this project.  Maps.ME is a free and open source OpenStreetMap based application designed for iOS and Android with an active repository.  We will consider re-using or integrating with the Maps.ME code base, though up front it appears to be a fairly large and mature project and more research is required.  The Maps.ME component would mostly provide mapping and navigation service portion to the application.  Our contribution would be to integrate OpenHIE and make the submission process health service centric.  We will reach out to the Maps.ME team to see if it’s possible to integrate this functionality as a plug-in to Maps.ME rather than a forked application or integrated.  Another disadvantage of Maps.ME is that it’s developed using an expensive ($450 per month) IDE – QT.</p><p> </p><p>Our preferred software stack for developing this product is the modern React Native framework which affords the best of both worlds with regards native UI components and a unified code base for cross platform mobile application development.  Native UI components provide a superior user experience through a more recognizable and speedier interface which translates to increased application adoption and use.  React Native does not require a commercial development environment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>User workflow to add a facility and meta data through Mobile Facility Mapper</strong></p><ol><li>Application startup: Splash screen with options to use the map, add a facility or configure the application</li><li>Configure settings: Allow download of facility data from Open Street Map or Master Facility Lists that you are subscribed to.  Allow add / edit of MFL – these could be national ministry repositories or partner repositories, etc.  Allow data to be downloaded over WiFi only to prevent unnecessary mobile data charges</li><li>Add a facility – take a geotagged photo of the facility to record location.  This can be performed from within the application at the splash screen or directly from the phone’s camera applications</li><li>Add a facility – if adding a facility from the camera application, tapping the share button allows you to send it to the facility mapping application.</li><li>Confirm Location – allows you to visually confirm the location using a satellite map background.</li><li>Capture additional details of the site if you know them</li><li>Select the repositories you wish to submit to.  General public will only be allowed to submit to Open Street Maps (they will need to sign up with Open Street Maps).  Partners, health workers, ministry staff, etc. will have appropriate rights to one or more facility lists that they can submit to.</li><li>Once submitted, Resource Map curators receive notification (email and mobile notification) to confirm an additional record has been added or an existing record has been updated.  They then sign in to the online Resource Map application and confirm or edit the suggested changes in a new staging component of Resource Map and choose to integrate or reject the suggested changes.  This allows MFL curators to maintain full control of the data while allowing it to be crowdsourced.  This could be a national MFL or a partner’s own facility list.</li><li>Though not included in the wireframe images above, we envisage a search and filter in the mobile application that allows users to find facilities by registry, facility type, Resource Map layer component (e.g. services provided).  Existing facility records would also be editable by staff with approved edit accessed</li><li>An additional feature could include linkages to external applications, for example a visitor or supplier could search for a facility they are wishing to travel to and request navigation assistance via Google Maps.</li></ol><p><strong>Diagram of the workflow</strong></p><p><img src="../sites/default/files/u49/pic3/index.png" alt="" width="800" height="294" /></p></div><div> </div><div><p><strong>Wireframe/mock up:</strong></p>Overview of data submission process to national repository</div><div><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Note to reviewer -

Haiti does not have a Master Facility List application; they maintain their master facility list through DHIS2. As part of this project, some or all of the facilities in DHIS2 will be loaded into the Mobile Facility Mapper tool. This will be a starting point for the crowdsourcing data collection. DAI will review the requirements from an end user’s perspective and also what is needed in Haiti. The DAI team members will provide feedback on the ease of use, accuracy of the data collection mechanism and how the data can be administered through a simple version of the OpenHIE Registry.</p><p> </p><p>DAI has both technical and programmatic experience and are ideal partners to give user feedback. Furthermore, Haiti is a challenging environment to work in and collect information so the testing will be realistic and uncover any major user experience issues or defects.</p><p> </p><p>Project Balance has joined the OpenHIE Facility Registry community and will solicit ideas and reach out for help where during the requirements phase and report to the group at key milestone points. Furthermore, we have reached out to InSTEDD who is heavily involve with managing the OpenHIE FR community to aid in soliciting ideas and feedback from the group to help us build a quality tool that meets standards and can be further enhanced by others. Project Balance will publish the Mobile Facility Mapper application as an open source contribution to this repository. This team will follow any required or recommended coding rules to conform to the community’s requirements.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>7)   </strong><strong>Self-Assessment on the Global Goods Maturity Model: </strong></p><p>Link to OpenHIE / Resource Map assessment <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WsLuuvJb3czT3uT1Ada727Xuv4D8TqGfZVNQrLhUv6M/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>8)   </strong><strong>Digital Health Atlas: </strong></p><p>A preliminary, published Digital Health Atlas project has been published and can be found at this URL: <a href="https://digitalhealthatlas.org/app/175/edit-project/publish/">https://digitalhealthatlas.org/app/175/edit-project/publish/</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>9)   </strong><strong>Workplan and Schedule: </strong></p><p>Below is the proposed workplan and schedule.</p><div class="WordSection1"><p>The workplan is separated by work bundles or packages.

Also, human resource capacity has often been highlighted as a possible challenge, which can also lead to limited quality and quantity in a claims audit process.</p><p>An electronic claims audit process could help identify FWA problems more efficiently. Claims management systems can benefit from the assistance of new affordable information, communication and technology (ICT), such as business intelligence and machine learning tools. Implementation of these tools could dramatically improve early detection of risky claims and enhance the processing of claims audits. This module will apply such tools in the case of FWA detection under the auditing of the claims management system and integrated module of openIMIS claim management functionalities.     </p><p>This proof of concept project will analyze claim data structure and claim adjudication rules for a fee-for-service based payments model. During the project, the openIMIS claims data structure will be studied and analyzed with the understanding of typical FWA patterns that are able to lead to the development of a customized expert decision system for FWA detection.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consortium Team </span></strong></p><p><strong>AUDENTA Consulting</strong> - Audenta consulting firm was founded in 2011 with the goal of consulting related to the business and management in health care and health insurance with a special focus to the application of advanced technologies in the health care system. In this project Audenta Consulting will be responsible for project management, claim management business rules and FWA detection models for claims system.</p><p><strong>ZAGREB EXCELLENCE INSTITUTE (ZEI)</strong> is NGO network established by the group of senior healthcare consultants with extensive management experience in mandatory health insurance, focusing on business excellence and improvement of national health systems. ZEI in this project will be responsible for Solution architecture and design, Machine learning and integration and project management, FWA detection models and use cases in fee-for-service based payments.</p><p><strong>SORSIX</strong> is a technology company headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices in Skopje, Macedonia and Dublin, Ireland. Sorsix provides bespoke software development services, consulting services, and its proprietary health platform Pinga and proprietary database technologies to customers in the healthcare, infrastructure, and telecommunications industries.Sorsix’s team has extensive experience in serving customers in the healthcare sector, at all levels – from GPs and administrative staff through to insurance providers at the state level. In this project, Sorsix will be responsible for assisting the consortium in solution design, and for providing the software development to build the FWA prevention tools and module into OpenIMIS.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span></strong></p><p>Claims management systems with the assistance of new affordable information, communication and technology (ICT), such as business intelligence and machine learning could dramatically improve detection of risky claims and enhance processes of claims auditing.  This module will apply such tools in the case of FWA detection under the auditing of the claims management system and integrated module of openIMIS claim management functionalities.</p><p>This proof of concept project will analyze claims data structure and claim adjudication rules in fee-for-service based payments. During the project, openIMIS claims data structure will be studied with the understanding of typical FWA patterns that are likely to lead to the development of customized expert decision system for FWA detection.  System and enhanced claims audit process will be piloted and adjusted with claims data model from primary, secondary and tertiary care. By relying on machine learning capabilities, the system/module should be expected to be constantly improved by increasing the number of cases that will be processed and detected as potentially “suspected” cases. </p><p>With FWA detection module, it is expected that a few auditors will be able to assess far many claims audit cases than through a random-based process like it is done today in the most payer organizations.  A qualitative and quantitative analysis will be carried out at the end of the project to lead to a management decision on the results of this intervention. </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical description</span></strong></p><p><em>A description of how your solution is interoperable with national health information architectures</em></p><p>The claim management process is one of the core business processes in the insurance business and is the core part of IMIS. FWA detection and prevention is essential for effective and successful health insurance business and should be a vital part of national health information architecture. FWA detection module should be incorporated in claim management system of the initial process of receiving and analyzing claims data structure and claim adjudication rules and giving prompt feedback to providers about technical or analytical claim issues and need for possible corrections. If FWA module should be integrated part of openIMIS and therefore interoperable with healthcare providers information systems.</p><p><em>Description of how your solution furthers the development of </em>openIMIS<em> and fits within the priorities and roadmap</em></p><p>We believe that FWA is the common problem for all health insurance organizations and developing FWA detection and prevention module as an integrated module in openIMIS should meet its the priorities. With this proof of concept project, all aspects of integration issues and roadmap priorities would be assessed and defined.</p><p><em>Project management approach</em></p><p>In this project, the market experience and project experience of the consortium members will be partnered with the software development capabilities of Sorsix. Sorsix has extensive experience providing software development in the healthcare and healthcare administration sector to a variety of customers.<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><p>Sorsix development teams follow a hybrid Agile approach, enabling adherence to a strong product vision while maintaining flexibility for changes within this vision to ensure development never stalls. As part of the hybrid Agile approach, Audenta and ZEI, with consultation from Sorsix and the OpenIMIS community, will generate a high-level scope of work and requirements. Sorsix teams will break this down into a detailed technical scope and execute this development with an Agile approach, enable fast builds from regular sprints to be demonstrated to the consortium and community for feedback.</p><p><em>Project Timeline </em></p><p>The project estimation is 10-12 calendar months, with 2 months of project preparations, 6 months of SW development, 2-4 months of uploading test claim data with machine learning adjustment and improving the scoring algorithms, producing project result reports and recommendations.</p><p><em>Potential obstacles and plan to overcome them</em></p><p>For a successful proof of concept, it is important to have realistic test claim data. Our target is to use actual historical anonymized health insurance claim data, over three to five consecutive years. To effect this, we will engage with the community and establish a project partnership with one or more health insurance organizations. Ideally it will be an organization already using openIMIS, simplifying the transition and use of data for this process, and supporting the openIMIS community. The support of openIMIS community will be important in providing contact and access to the appropriate kind of historical anonymized data. An alternative possibility could be to use data from some other country/payer and to transform the claim data in openIMIS format. Provision for the data engineering necessary in such a step has been made in determining the size of the project.</p><p>Another potential obstacle may be enabling the key value-added components of the FWA tool to adapt to different regulatory environments. We plan to mitigate this by adapting to existing configuration options in openIMIS and engaging with the broader openIMIS community to ensure that workflows that have been experienced by openIMIS users have been met. </p><p><strong>Tagging</strong></p><p>* Claim management</p><p>* Fee-for-service</p><p>* Fraud, Waste, Abuse (FWA) detection and prevention</p><p>* Machine learning</p><p>* openIMIS</p><p>* Health insurance information system</p><p>* Interoperability</p><p>* Proof of concept</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-proposal-status field-type-list-text field-label-inline clearfix"><div class="field-label">Application Status:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> Approved - partially funded</div></div></div>

Look at packaging the QEWD and OpenHIM to have a deployable example of this and be an option for the "transformation" libraries that I remember QEWD has. We could also look at identifying a roadmap of future "transformation" that could be written around patient data saving and or lookups?</p><p>I hope this isn't too late and again apologies around the delay in responding.

The development of this solution will support the openIMIS Initiative vision of making openIMIS interoperable with national health information architectures and, ultimately, support Nepal’s path to universal health coverage.</p><h3>Consortium Team</h3><p>Possible has a dynamic team of experienced technology innovators that support our efforts to transform health systems for underserved populations. Anant Raut, Possible’s Director of Informatics, led the rollout of our EHR system at our hospital hubs and oversees our innovative digital systems design and quality improvement efforts.

Developing a Bahmni-openIMIS Integration system will streamline processes around checking/validating patients with insurance, submitting claims, and tracking claims status.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Once this module is developed, one will be able to determine the validity and available balance of a person’s insurance account from within Bahmni itself. Users will be able to submit claims and track the status of these claims as “approved” or “rejected” within the system.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Concurrently, billing encounters for each patient will be synced with Odoo (OpenERP) and differentiated either as insurance claims or non-insurance bills. Managers will be able to generate reports on claims/non-claims from Odoo and utilize features like sorting and filtering for improved costing and planning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/1/d/sDsJAkC7gdK6OlQK1ruzNwg/image?w=509&amp;h=159&amp;rev=26&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1eUzIFGOR8ZoLp_uM0l7MhFXW5pIMAZEtnubzT6FyF94" alt="" width="509" height="159" /></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>To accomplish this, Possible will carry out the following steps:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">1. Conduct Bahmni EHR User Interface changes to support collecting and displaying insurance related information of patient.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">2. Develop IMIS-Connect java based rest application which can be plugged in as a service on existing Bahmni environment and acts as a gateway for communication with insurance system (openIMIS), with Bahmni. Major functions include:</span></p><ul><li>Validity check</li><li>Balance check</li><li>Submit claims</li><li>Track status of the claims</li><li>Resubmit the rejected claims</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">3.

For instance, earlier this year, we successfully integrated the Nepal Ministry of Health’s District Health Information System (DHIS2) with</span><span> NepalEHR</span><span>, allowing for seamless and automatic reporting of facility data to the central government health database. Direct integration of facility-based OpenMRS and national DHIS2 is the first of its kind anywhere in the world. DHIS 2 is the open-source information system with dynamic visualization features including mapping of diseases and customized dashboards that allow clinicians to look for trends and scan for epidemics in real time. It is also the preferred health management information system in 46 countries and helps governments better manage healthcare delivery efforts. This integration greatly simplifies the data management process, eliminating the burden of reporting on the clinicians whose time is better spent on patient care.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Director of Informatics will lead Possible’s Nepal-based EHR team in the development and implementation of the Bahmni-openIMIS integration system. The two Java developers will lead the development and testing of the application, incorporating user feedback in further refinements throughout the project. Possible’s two systems engineers, Sr. EHR Associate, and Sr. Data Registration Assistant will work together to lead the deployment of the integration application at two public hospitals over the course of the year-long project. They will also support the training of users and administrators and conduct ongoing maintenance and support for the application.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Our team of technology innovators will work closely with Possible’s finance team who will support claims status tracking and help develop relevant reports to track reimbursements for claims.

As the developer of the first integrated EHR in Nepal with a demonstrated track record of delivering technology-enabled longitudinal care, system efficiencies and quality improvement, we are uniquely positioned to respond to the growing interest in digitization and partner with the Government to expand the use of </span><span>NepalEHR</span><span> within the public health sector.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Along with refinements to </span><span>NepalEHR</span><span>, promoting implementation of the EHR in the public sector will be a priority for Possible over the next three years. We have already taken steps in this direction. For instance, beginning in December 2017, Possible, in collaboration with the German development agency, GIZ, began the process of implementing our EHR product at Nepal’s Trishuli District Hospital in Nuwakot District. This is an important milestone since it allows us to demonstrate the use and uptake of the EHR in government hospitals that are not under Possible’s management. We are also currently considering other similar opportunities to scale use of our EHR within the public health system. With this fertile environment for innovation and potential for national scale, the integration of openIMIS with </span><span>NepalEHR</span><span> presents an exciting opportunity to accelerate Nepal’s progress towards universal health coverage through a seamless system for public sector health facilities to accept insurance and receive reimbursements. Furthermore, the integration of the two open source systems will have global implications for other countries attempting to launch new national health insurance schemes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>a) Technical Approach </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Currently, Bahmni does not integrate an insurance workflow. The manual workflow to submit claims for those insured in openIMIS is time-intensive and inefficient. Developing a Bahmni-openIMIS integration system will streamline processes around checking and validating patients with insurance, submitting claims, and tracking claims status.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Possible’s proposed solution is an integration of openIMIS with the existing Bahmni EHR to support a seamless and unobtrusive insurance workflow. Possible will install the application, a REST-based API service, within the existing Bahmni EHR system. The Bahmni EHR will interact with this application through the API, and the application will then connect with IMIS-APIs for processing the claims.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>As a component of Bahmni EHR, the application will interface directly with openIMIS for processing claims through the claim life cycle. Possible will also execute UI changes within its Bahmni EHR platform to display relevant insurance details of patients. In addition, we will add insurance TAGs on the Odoo (OpenERP) UI for invoices and process buttons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Once this module is developed, one will be able to determine the validity and available balance of a person’s insurance account from within Bahmni. Users will be able to submit claims and track the status of these claims as “approved” or “rejected” within the system. Possible will be able to generate reports for the insurance-tagged Bills/invoices from Odoo and send claimable invoices to the openIMIS system.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Concurrently, billing encounters for each patient will be synced with Odoo and differentiated either as insurance claims or non-insurance bills. Managers will be able to generate reports on claims/non-claims from Odoo and utilize features like sorting and filtering for improved costing and planning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/1/d/sBdzi8n9HC0b0S3eisf5rUw/image?w=509&amp;h=159&amp;rev=1&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=13kJumNvc2RpTk4wGcAQ8afvcPgQggbxBM271wadi4Pg" alt="" width="509" height="159" /></span></p><span><span><br /></span></span><p dir="ltr"><strong>b) Use of Digital Health Technologies</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Figure 1 (below) shows the overall interactions between the IMIS-connect application, the EHR system and the openIMIS System.

It will be built as a component service for Bahmni EHR. The existing server for Bahmni EHR will be capable of running this service in terms of memory, CPU utilization, and database space.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>c) Workplan and Schedule</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Possible anticipates completing and implementing the integration of openIMIS with Bahmni within 12 months of project commencement. To date, Possible has completed several activities in preparation of this integration project. We have conducted an initial requirement analysis in collaboration with Nepal’s Ministry of Health and GIZ. In addition, we have observed the current insurance and hospital workflow at one of our implementation sites, Bayalpata Hospital in Nepal’s Achham district, and interviewed users to understand their technical needs. Finally, we have drafted a systems requirement specification document that was shared with the broader Bahmni/OpenMRS community.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Gantt chart below outlines the phases, activities, and timeline for achieving each activity over the course of the 12-month project. </span></p><span><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-181d1adc-7fff-fc9a-55a2-ff38b55ff515"><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PtcRiZvgyfrcxMKhekJy5OGAWpnrGpqB5WxioLz1TETRtQX11zyHbj2yJpNmvf4Zx11vlQ0etBhMRXGHDWY7mmsjiBpJdJPevfCEOBH8qX32_nuO0S6rUoKP_MdD6nHLk7IW_ofB" alt="" width="624" height="863" /><br /></span></span></span></span><span><span><br /></span></span><p dir="ltr"><span><span><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-88cb230e-7fff-728d-c4ac-5d703d8b5c6c">d) Digital Health Atlas</span></strong><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Possible has registered </span><span>NepalEHR </span><span>in the Digital Health Atlas, as shown here: </span><a href="https://digitalhealthatlas.org/public/180/assessment">https://digitalhealthatlas.org/public/180/assessment</a><span>.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-16d6fc21-7fff-b28c-3967-d6822887438e">e) Project Deliverables</span></strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Over the two phases of the project, Possible will achieve the following key deliverables:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Phase I: Outpatient workflow</span></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Registration billing feature in Bahmni complete;</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>openIMIS integration module for OPD workflow developed;</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Training and deployment at Bayalpata Hospital in Achham complete;</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Technical documentation of OPD insurance integration including product architecture and installation guide for implementers complete.</span></p></li></ol><p dir="ltr"><span>Phase II: Inpatient and Emergency workflow</span></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Billing feature developed in Bahmni;</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>openIMIS integration module for IPD and ER workflow complete;</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Technical documentation of OPD insurance integration including product architecture and installation guide for implementers complete;</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>User Training Manual complete.</span></p></li></ol><h3 dir="ltr"><span>Two-Sentence Overview</span></h3><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>In Nepal, where the government recently passed a National Health Insurance Act, citizens and healthcare providers require novel systems to efficiently process insurance claims, reimburse providers, and, ultimately, achieve the country’s vision of universal healthcare coverage. Possible is developing an application that will seamlessly integrate the leading open source EHR (Bahmni) and the openIMIS insurance system to improve access to healthcare for the insured and reimbursement funds for providers. Once developed and tested, this application can be utilized to scale up insurance uptake nationally within Nepal and easily adapted to additional countries where Bahmni and openIMIS are currently in use.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>The investment will go towards the design and development of the application. It will also go towards the implementation and refinement of the application at two public hospitals in Nepal.</span></p></li></ol><h3 dir="ltr"><span>Community Feedback</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>Possible will engage with the broader digital health community through the Bahmni Coalition, a network of 15 organizations from numerous countries that collaborate around the Bahmni hospital information system. We will work with the Bahmni Coalition to obtain feedback and input, especially with regard to the architecture and design of our application prior to starting development. Once we develop the application, much of the architecture and components should be universally applicable in other settings where Bahmni and openIMIS are being implemented.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We will continue to incorporate feedback from the broader community following development and implementation of our application. In collaboration with the Coalition, we will identify other organizations and national governments that are attempting to utilize openIMIS for insurance enrollment, reimbursement, and claims processing. We will share any lessons learned with partners and continue to iterate on our application based on the insights gained by other organizations implementing the application.</span></p><h3 dir="ltr"><span>Use Cases, User Stories</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>There are three types of users that will interact with the system: Registration desk staff at our hospitals, finance staff and claims submitting users. Each of these three types of users will use the application differently; as such, each will have their own requirements.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Registration desk staff</span><span> will use the Bahmni UI to collect NHIS numbers from patients, check for the validity of the insurance account, and determine the balance left in the account, if valid. They will use the Bahmni UI to do the same for revisiting patients if their insurance details have not already been collected.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The claim submitter</span><span> (a to-be-identified staff member at each hospital location) will use Odoo to submit the insurance-tagged invoices for further processing. They will also be responsible for the tracking the status of claims and resubmitting the rejected claims after correction (in case of known mistakes in claims). The UI in Odoo will be modified for supporting these actions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Finance staff</span><span> will be able to check the reports from Odoo for the claimed and billed amounts. They will be able to generate different periodic reports based on the requirements such as total claim reports, non-claims and not-claimable reports.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Figure 2 below shows the actions of the various players and openIMIS in the new workflow post implementation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><img title="F" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BKZ2BJu8gnvXc3qeXopD_N1GQPdUkkFl601mU321sZnjsUEm7fU9QESjr21DGEMTkFY-mpWoBrQAbSD_YpErs4cjThOkH3vdEk7tV4pxq8rT0jWyOn-NHESrge6qzJxy7DohmUCv" alt="" width="624" height="536" /></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><em>Figure 2: Insurance Workflow</em><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The appendix includes a figure (Figure 3) detailing the step-by-step decision-making process from assessing a patient’s insurance status to processing a claim and tracking the status.</span></p><h3 dir="ltr"><span>Self-Assessment on the Global Goods Maturity Model</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>Possible has completed the self-assessment here: </span><span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCb0BZ0Ni8ihS1JVXAxg938E62cW86vgEFpSJXpw0HE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCb0BZ0Ni8ihS1JVXAxg938E62cW86vgEFpSJXpw0HE/edit?usp=sharing</a></span></p><h3 dir="ltr"><span>Tagging</span></h3><div><p dir="ltr">See response in Concept Note section above.</p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-proposal-status field-type-list-text field-label-inline clearfix"><div class="field-label">Application Status:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> Pending Review &amp; Investment</div></div></div>
