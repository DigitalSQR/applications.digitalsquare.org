Combining good design and fast algorithms can make an otherwise daunting task intuitive, transparent, and accessible. Planwise makes optimizing the coverage of a service network (e.g., health facilities or schools) as easy as getting driving directions on your phone. It can analyze and generate coverage or catchment maps for your program &amp; then suggest the most impactful options to improve access or capacity. Planwise does this without needing external consultants, forcing users to difficult to use or proprietary datasets or hire a data scientist. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-9b022651-7fff-f5ea-0769-49bbe687a7d8"><span>See a brief video: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRbo7xTx_Xw"><span>https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRbo7xTx_Xw</span></a></span>     </span><img style="font-size: 0.9em;" src="../sites/default/files/u125/screen_shot_2018-07-20_at_3.41.11_pm/index.png" alt="" width="316" height="212" /><img style="font-size: 0.9em;" src="../sites/default/files/u125/screen_shot_2018-07-20_at_3.41.04_pm/index.png" alt="" width="345" height="169" /></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Now, the Planwise community is seeking to mature, grow, and extend the community of implementers for increased impact. Specifically, we are seeking to:</span></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><span>Formalize and grow the community of implementers</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Create and deploy a strategy for replication and scaled impact</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Extend Planwise functionality to fill priority community-identified gaps</span></li></ol><h2 dir="ltr">Planwise Project Description</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>This concept note seeks to catalyze and respond to the current demand to mature the Planwise community and solution. By providing free to use, powerful planning tools, to augment the human insights to planners and managers, it is possible to achieve significant impact. The Planwise solution to date has the core components available for completing this process.  </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In communities around the world, significant proportions of the population live outside the reach of critical, life-saving, health or other social services. Access to care is affected by the demand for services being greater than their capacity or that the distance an individual must travel is too far. Community and program leaders, planners, and managers are responsible for increasing access to these services but must do so without understanding the current geographic coverage area and how to optimize access to care efficiently.</span></p><p><span>Planwise solves this challenge by taking three categories of data and bringing them together in a coordinated way. The tool uses data on the current population, overlaying road and walking time calculations, and lastly locations of service networks or the health system. Each of these types of data is now available via open global services, see below for specific details. Together these data sets combined with the industry-leading best practice algorithms, and optimization techniques allow a ministry of health or NGO program manager to use Planwise to see three critical pieces of analysis:</span></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><span>The current coverage of the health system and quantified current capacity.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Identify areas where coverage is missing; Or with an overloaded network.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Receive suggested scenarios for how to best enhance the service delivery network for maximum impact.</span></li></ul><p><span>In the future, we also plan to include other modifiers on service demand, such as disease epidemiology or the quality of services provided at a facility. This type of service is possible due to the existence of global services, including: </span></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><strong>WorldPop</strong><span> that provides an open-access archive of spatial demographic datasets for the developing world. </span></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Open Street Maps (OSM)</strong><span> that provides open road network data - while incomplete in some places, it represents the best scalable service for this data. Initiatives such as Missing Maps can also help to close these gaps for implementation partners. </span></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Google Earth Engine</strong><span> and the collaboration with the University of South Hampton have recently made friction surface data accessible, to allow for walking time calculations. </span></li><li dir="ltr"><span><strong>Any geospatial dataset</strong> for a service network,</span><span> including OpenHIE. Planwise allows for CSV uploads, and in the future, we plan to support common formats/standards of geospatial location data.</span></li></ol><p><span>The application of Planwise began with maternal and child health and laboratory planning, but has expanded as more partners engage including more broadly:</span></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><span><strong>Primary healthcare</strong> delivery</span><span>, particularly for maternal and child health programs seeking to deploy new facilities, upgrade facilities, add ambulances, mobile clinics</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span><strong>Laboratory</strong> or referral networks,</span><span> where facilities collect a sample or interact with a patient before further testing or treatment at a second location.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span><strong>Staffing and training</strong>,</span><span> to improve the capacity and quality of staff located within the network of locations.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span><strong>Village or site-level interventions</strong></span><span>, disaster response where a team sets up for a period to offer emergency services or to support a public health campaign.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Radio tower placement</strong><span> and capacity for international development projects that provide educational programming and behavior change content.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Water well and school placement</strong><span> to maximize impact for investments in access and availability of critical services.</span></li></ul><p><span>Past design and implementation partners include Concern Worldwide and the African Society of Laboratory Medicine (ALSM) - implementing in Niger, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Our partners plan to scale-up of these activities in the next 6 months. Other key partners have been identified across half a dozen other nonprofits and social impact organizations, and are working in many countries across Africa and Asia. Planwise is already operational in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Central Africa Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nepal, Niger, Pakistan, Philippines, Tanzania, Thailand, and Uganda. Additional countries are actively being provided routinely through current program activities.</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e8111fc1-7fff-5c32-4972-5d0fa23f5fd0"><span>Open Source Repository: </span><span><a href="https://github.com/instedd/planwise">https://github.com/instedd/planwise via GPLv3</a></span></span></p><h2 dir="ltr">Technical Approach</h2><div><p dir="ltr"><span>InSTEDD, working with existing partners, has already developed and deployed a working and stable cloud-hosted instance of Planwise that is free to use. We want to build on this success to see Planwise implementations replicated and impact scaled. The following objectives are required to achieve our impact goals: </span></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><span>Formalize and grow the community of implementers</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Strategy for replication and scaled impact</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Extend Planwise functionality to fill priority community-identified gaps</span></li></ol><h3 dir="ltr"><span>1: Formalize and Grow the Community of Implementers</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>A grassroots network of Planwise implementers has emerged through InSTEDD’s leadership and partner network.  Our first objective for this project is to formalize this engagement and create an open community and governance structure that collects and shares experience, knowledge, as well as informs the future development of Planwise.  This is critical to achieving NGO-driven replication of Planwise use and to facilitate transparent collaboration among partners. Activities include:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Activity 1.1: Design and Document a Governance Model -</strong> </span><span>First, we propose to design and document, with key stakeholders, a governance model for the Planwise OSS solution that makes it clear how groups can contribute or collaborate, protect intellectual property, and prioritize the future development of Planwise. Protecting the intellectual property of experts is essential, specifically for the data science associated with geospatial modeling and optimization. The license for Planwise will continue to be open-source GPLv3.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Activity 1.2: Setup Digital Community Resources and Infrastructure -</strong> </span><span>We propose to set-up online community tools and establish resources for Planwise implementers and partners. It should be simple and straightforward for contributors or implementers to connect with the community and learn the basics about how to use or contribute to Planwise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Activity 1.3: Operationalize and Run the Community </strong><span>-</span><span> Operationalize and Run the Community - Once the foundational pieces of an online community are in place, the task of operationalizing and managing the community can begin. This process necessitates a blend of providing routine value to others, as well as fostering organic community participation. To more explicitly engage implementers, we plan to document case studies from 3 implementers and empower them to share their experiences through the community.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Deliverables:</strong> </em></p><ol><li>Published governance and community model for Planwise;</li><li>Operationalized community with participation from stakeholders using Planwise,</li><li>With online resources and infrastructure ready. (e.g., wiki, chat-forums, and calendar of events) &amp; Communication Tools - Simple website and onboarding materials</li><li>3 Planwise implementer case-studies.</li></ol><h3 dir="ltr"><span>2: Strategy for Replication and Scaled Impact</span></h3><div><span>We believe the Planwise solution is ready for scale and replication to any program looking to make data-driven decisions for where investments are made to improve service. To achieve this, we are seeking to create and implement a strategy for replication and scale.  By designing such a strategy or model with scale and replication in mind, our team is seeking to find a sustainable pathway to achieve replication and increased impact; in addition to being able to maintain and extend Planwise functionality. Our experience from past open source initiatives is that quality technology alone can’t achieve the type of impact we are seeking.  That designing a strong program, engaging the right partners and executing on the model is just as critical to success. Activities include:</span></div><div><span><span><br /></span></span><span><strong>Activity 2.1: Bootstrap Implementation Support for Key Impact Partners</strong> - </span><span>New partners may be interested in exploring the use of Planwise, but have difficulty facilitating it for existing programs. We would like to help these partners bootstrap Planwise into their organizations.  As part of the program, we propose to seed fund 3-5 organizations to explore Planwise utilization across their programs. Increasing the number of implementers are critical to many aspects of this project, but also for this program to have a direct and measurable impact.</span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span><strong>Activity 2.2: Design and Test Models for Sustainability</strong> - </span><span>Designing solutions that can have a scaled impact require a focus on developing and testing models that facilitate replication. We do not anticipate a single funder supporting Planwise directly, so instead, we plan to create a model of services and an associated program that helps partners easily replicate Planwise implementation.  While this makes it easier for partners to integrate Planwise into their programs, it also helps to make Planwise more sustainable. We would also like to explore the potential to identify other pathways for sustainability, such as private sector licensing. </span><span>When our team has a first version of the model developed, we plan to test the model among partners; and using qualitative/quantitative analysis to evaluate what works and experimenting as we go.  Further, this includes seeking to formally collaborate with key actors such as WorldPop and other geospatial communities of practice.</span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span><strong>Activity 2.3: Production of Support Materials</strong> - </span><span>An organizations decision to begin using a solution like Planwise, necessitates some degree of disruption of their status-quo; as Planwise is genuinely a novel service that allows them to leapfrog several maturity steps. We would like to develop a simple set of community materials that assist in the onboarding of implementation partners and also helps them to quickly and independently begin using Planwise.  Facilitating easy use is critical, as Planwise often disrupts or is an entirely novel concept for some groups. We want to make it as easy as possible for groups to take advantage of Planwise.</span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><strong>Activity 2.4: Mobilize a Publication / Scientific Literature Committee</strong><span> that reviews best practice literature for geospatial modeling, creates a research plan with implementers/universities, develops abstracts and publications that are then submitting to journals and presented at conferences.  Participation by researchers is critical as Planwise can both contribute to, and benefit from a rapidly changing landscape of geospatial analytics and other data science techniques. By fostering a group of researchers who can grow the knowledge base, the quality of Planwise will results will improve, and we will attract more research-minded users.</span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><em><strong>Deliverables:</strong> </em></div><ol><li dir="ltr"><span>3-5 organizations using Planwise</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>A tested model to support replication and scalability</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>User support materials, to help users independently solve their issues and use the tool. </span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Research committee, working towards publications with partner researchers and associated implementers</span></li></ol><h3 dir="ltr"><span>3: Extend Planwise Functionality to Fill Community-identified Gaps</span></h3><div><span>As is the case with most open-source software projects; there are usability, interoperability, and critical aspects of functionality where dedicated investment could help foster additional scale and grow the community of implementers by removing barriers to their use. Any investment or enhancements made to the solution will use the roadmap created by implementers.  This feedback loop is critical because we want to ensure that Planwise maps to implementers needs, and is reactive to users. Also, as we begin new collaborations, we will learn more about how Planwise should work, and being able to have the flexibility to respond to those findings will be vital to staying relevant. Activities for this objective include: </span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><strong>Activity 3.1: Load additional country metadata for 50 countries</strong><span> (e.g., roads, friction surfaces, &amp; population). We currently have 10 countries loaded as of September 2018 and expect to have approximately 15-20 by December 2018 - all of which have been funded by current implementers. Any implementer can use loaded metadata once it has been loaded for a country, amortizing the investment.  This is key so that countries can easily begin using Planwise in their priority countries that are not currently covered. </span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><strong>Activity 3.2: Enable additional planning scenarios </strong><span><strong>and functionality</strong> </span><span>- Planwise supports two forms of planning right now; 1) Referral scenarios (e.g., lab tests or transport for services) and 2) direct service access. There are other types of planning scenarios and dimensions of planning we have already identified from partners that would be useful to provide straightforward templates for Planwise use (e.g., Outbreak preparedness/response, capacity building, malaria eradication, etc.).  We would like to work with implementers to document their needs and collaboratively create a roadmap for enhancing Planwise. This will increase participation by partners, and build in a feedback loop to respond to users critical needs. </span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><strong>Activity 3.3: Ensure interoperability with partner systems </strong><span>by implementing standards that are common in the health and geospatial data domain. Typical standards include ones such as FHIR, mCSD, or other geospatial-based standards such as those supported by the Open Geospatial Community. Interoperability with services like DHIS2 or Healthsites.io is a priority. Planwise does support integrations with facility registry applications currently as well as providing a simple CSV import functionality as well for service location data. Making Planwise interoperable with common standards will help increase partners ability to import their service networks.</span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><strong>Activity 3.4: Interfaces to enable fine tuning and experiments by GIS experts.</strong><span> By enabling Planwise to act as a hub for research and improving geospatial optimization and planning techniques; not only with implementers and the platform be enhanced, but the state of knowledge around geospatial modeling.  Also, this functionality will target supporting the consultants and experts who often carry out these types of activities manually. Planwise can then act as a tool that enables experts to go further in their analysis and recommendations, focusing on more sophisticated issues and research questions.</span><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><em><strong>Deliverables:</strong> </em></div><ol><li dir="ltr"><span>50 new countries with loaded metadata; where implementation will now be possible. </span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Community-generated roadmap of enhancements; to support user prioritized functionality and planning scenario project templates.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Enhanced Planwise deployed and shared as open source software (GPLv3)</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>Interoperability with OpenHIE / geospatial information systems.</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span>GIS expert interface in Planwise, to enable research and customization of modeling algorithms.</span></li></ol></div><h2 dir="ltr">Consortium Team</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>InSTEDD is a non-profit, human-centered design, and software development organization based in California, with innovation labs (iLabs) located in Southeast Asia and Latin America.

Over the last five years our focus has been on developing open source tools to support Result-based Financing programs in over 20 countries. We also work towards improving how the data that is already available can be better leveraged to help ensure effective decision making.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The software products Bluesquare develops connect to technologies like DHIS2. From a technical perspective, our team of developers have a broad range of skills in Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, React, Javascript. Our team also brings broad experience within the social health insurance systems in Belgium.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Results for Development (R4D)</span><span> works with change agents around the globe to create self-sustaining systems that support healthy, educated people. Their specific experience in health systems includes a focus on health financing and working towards Universal Health Care. R4D experts inform planning and policymaking through data analytics and by strengthening the technical capacity of local change agents in countries seeking cost-efficient and sustainable systems. They focus on supporting governments in the design and execution of social and national health insurance schemes. They do this by developing practical guidance that can foster dialogue on the alignment of public financial management and health financing and by exploring strategies that can help countries improve value for money and better leverage their existing resources.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In addition to this technical expertise, R4D is building global communities of practitioners and policymakers who are engaged in collaborative learning around the achievement of universal health coverage and sustainable health financing solutions. For instance, in 2010, R4D helped launch the Joint Learning Network — a thriving, member-driven community of global health policymakers and practitioners who are working together to collectively address barriers to achieving universal health coverage. R4D has served as the JLN network coordinator from 2010 to 2018 and continues to serve as technical facilitator for a number of different technical initiatives including the Primary Health Care Initiative and the Provider Payment Initiative</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>R4D has committed to provide an international sounding board using their rich network of actors. In the longer term, they also plan to use this project as a chance to begin the dialogue process with the JLN to broaden the network to be involved.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>IntraHealth</span><span>. From mobile apps to management software to multilanguage interactive voice response, Intrahealth offers health workers and managers the tools and technology they need to do their very best work. Intrahealth develops solutions that are open source, data-driven, sustainable, and collaborative. And as a pioneer in the field of health workforce informatics, Intrahealth is committed to using technology, information, and analytical approaches to support the people at the center of health systems.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>AEDES</span><span>, the European Agency for Development and Health, is a consulting company specialized in public health in low and middle-income countries. Experts of AEDES include specialists in public health, health economics, pharmacy, eHealth, etc.  Among others, AEDES is invested in supporting Health Information Systems with a focus on challenging operating environment. AEDES started supporting the development of CERHIS - an open source EMR - in 2014 in collaboration with the Université Libre de Bruxelles. CERHIS as a full-solution health facility tablet based package that includes hardware storage, power supply, server and in facility data exchange. Implementation include countries like DRC and Burundi. AEDES will contribute in ensuring that CERHIS is interoperable with the OpenIMIS platform, offering a ready to use point of care digital solution, and can provide eHealth and medical insurance expertise to help for the technical and content design of OpenIMIS.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Relevant Qualifications</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Bluesquare’s origins are in Result-based Financing data systems. Over time, we have grown from that space and truly become a trusted data partner in international efforts toward Universal Health Coverage. We remain the lead company in the RBF data systems space and the tools we have developed have great potential for broader applications over time. Data flows for RBF programming are similar to data flows in health insurance. The main difference is that RBF programs have focused over the last years on aggregated data rather than individual data. However, RBF schemes are moving towards patient level data and the digital tools that Bluesquare provides evolve towards patient level data. Many new “tax-financed” health insurances that countries are setting up for accelerating Universal Health Coverage have a similar design as  RBF schemes. Bluesquare’s contribution will ensure that future OpenIMIS design can both create value for health insurance and RBF systems, multiplying the possible use cases.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In addition, from a pure development perspective, Bluesquare is proud of its strong team of agile developers. They have broad experience in software development both in Bluesquare’s own products and with other custom products (i.e. we have a team working on a sleeping sickness elimination data platform). All of our developers have strong experience in interoperability of global public goods software. And at the heart of it all, our products are all interoperable with DHIS2. From our tool linking ODK to DHIS2 to our Data Visualisation tool enriching DHIS2.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We would be able to collaborate closely with the developers from Intrahealth, AEDES or other groups willing to join this initiative.  </span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Related Work</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Through its work on strategic purchasing and RBF data systems in more than twenty countries, Bluesquare has a broad experience of purchasing systems and claim management. Bluesquare has also a broad experience of interoperability with other digital square tools. For the last two years, Bluesquare develops a RBF suite of tools built on four software modules that can directly be plugged on other digital square tools, in particular DHIS2. Our experience with both the build of modular products and interoperability by design will help define a modular roadmap for OpenIMIS.       </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>As the developer of ORBF, Bluesquare has experience with the creation of a data tool that will address claim management and complex computations. The creation process was one that allowed us to identify needs and evolve the tool over time in close collaboration with many actors and partners.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Bluesquare has also worked on a health insurance project in Benin (CONSAMUS). This project was the implementation of a CBHI (Community Base Health Insurance) data system in Benin based on DHIS2 for the Ministry of Health. And our team of developers have health insurance data system experience with the national health insurance in Belgium.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Qualification of key members of proposed project team</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Our development team</span></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Martin Van Aken</strong> </span><span>is a full stack software developer with 15+years experience in software development, including the health insurance sector in Europe.

We are celebrating our 6th year.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 20.16px; color: #f48024;">Project Description</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Strengthening the governance structure for the OpenIMIS upgrade</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We envision the OpenIMIS rebuild initiative as a collaborative software development effort. Different software modules would be developed by different groups in a coordinated way. The goal would be to complement and reinforce the initial efforts of GIZ and the Swiss Cooperation. To accomplish this collaboration, we propose a formal software steering committee.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The role of this steering committee group would be threefold : </span></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Organize and structure the software development (tools, modules, use cases, roadmap).</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Setup a health insurance and RBF user group that would help prioritize the software development. With the help of R4D, we would work together to seek approval from the JLN Steering Group to anchor this collaboration within the JLN network, an international network of national health insurers.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Identify the necessary resources for the broader and longer-term rebuild of the OpenIMIS module:  R4D, Intrahealth, AEDES and Bluesquare have established strong collaborations with several potential supporters and funders for this initiative (i.e. WHO, BMGF, USAID, KFW, GFF, EU, P4H, Belgium...).             </span></p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><span>The first step would be a kickoff meeting where the participating organisations Bluesquare, AEDES, Intrahealth and R4D can help define the rules of the collaboration with the existing OpenIMIS stakeholders (Swiss Government, GIZ, KFW). We propose to further expand the group to others (including for example SwissTPH, HISP or SolDevelo).</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Developing the first prototype - as part of this current proposal - will require ongoing and close collaboration with the steering committee and various other stakeholders. Doing so will help ensure alignment with user needs. In practice this also means working in an iterative way: we define features together, present and discuss mockups and push test versions to the advising group and other users on a regular basis.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This, of course follows the well known “agile” approach to development with a focus on a “lean” working style that is pragmatic in this specific field. By going this route we build only the key features in close collaboration with the end users.   </span></p><h2><span><span><br /></span></span></h2><h3 dir="ltr"><span>A. Technical approach of the OpenIMIS rebuild</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>OpenIMIS is a large code base and it is unrealistic to envision a comprehensive rebuild of the tool with the resources made available in this request for proposals. The rebuild of the instrument will require that other resources be raised. Rather, in this proposal Blesquare suggests to (i) setup the governance structure that will help steer the OpenIMIS project beyond this initial project, (ii) demonstrate how an open and collaborative software approach could be initiated, and (iii) trial a modular and iterative rebuild approach to determine how it could successfully take place.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The directions that Bluesquare has identified for the rebuild is to (i) modularise OpenIMIS into different software modules that would enhance the capacity of the tool to integrate itself into different country data ecosystems, (ii) build the new OpenIMIS to ensure that it does not duplicate features that are already supported by other ‘digital square’ instruments, in particular OpenMRS and DHIS2.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The claim management prototype that we propose to develop as part of this proposal will draw patient data, Health Facility Registry data and care delivery information data from existing systems. The data sources will vary by the type of data. For instance: </span></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>The patient level data will be imported from existing OpenIMIS deployments or existing OpenMRS instances. </span><span>The prototype claim management engine would assume that the patient enrollment and data is handled in a separate patient level data base.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>The Health Facility Registry data will come from a DHIS2 instance. Health facility accreditation will be managed in DHIS2. </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>The HR data will come from an existing HR database such as IHRIS.   </span></p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><span>The new OpenIMIS claim management prototype would focus on defining and editing the benefit packages, the insurance products, prices and rules. It would then link these variables to patients (patient data) and health care providers (HFR data). In this vision, the software development would also parametrize the claims engine so it can support any HI scheme. In much the same way as an RBF calculation, the prototype tool would generate both the claim computations and payment orders. And aggregated service delivery data would be handled through an export to DHIS2.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Communication with any external system will be completed in adequation with the FHIR HL7 standards, notably for Patient and Organisation. The OpenIMIS resources shall themselves be available in the same format (example: Claim).</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><br /></span></p><h3 dir="ltr"><span>B. Use of Digital Health Technologies</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>For the claims management prototype, our aim is to build an insurance system on top of the best available data which is currently collected. Since integration with tools such as OpenMRS, DHIS2 and others will be key, we will look to the steering committee for insights and support to ensure alignment on those points. The integration should also respect health standards when they exist (example: FHIR) and technical best practices (for example, using REST based API with token-based authentication).</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In the context of the prototype, this leads to an architecture where we would be retreiving and sending information to OpenMRS can easily be done using its REST API (</span><a href="https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/REST+Web+Services+API+For+Clients"><span>https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/REST+Web+Services+API+For+Clients</span></a><span>). The same logic will be applied to get entity level data from DHIS2 (</span><a href="https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/developer/html/webapi.html"><span>https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/developer/html/webapi.html</span></a><span>).</span></p><h2><span><span><br /></span></span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://docs.google.com/a/bluesquarehub.com/drawings/d/sqMmF8sBgmdjUmqniRxdu4Q/image?w=438&amp;h=356&amp;rev=140&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1iLbkgzWOX3BvIXCKBbS8oO08DkCgO94ynB1tiV2__aA" alt="" width="438" height="356" /></span></p><h2><span><span><br /></span></span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>In this simple model, we see a double exchange of data happening.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>On one side, the claim module of OpenIMIS would capture the Health Facility Registry data from a national level DHIS2 instance, using the Web API to retrieve the whole pyramid (this is shown as a one-time data exchange here but could be used on a regular basis to keep OpenIMIS up to date).</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>On the other side, OpenIMIS would collect Patient data (Patient, Encounter and Observation) from OpenMRS.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>From the health insurance packages defined at OpenIMIS level, the software will be able to identify which (if any) of the benefits the patient is eligible to receive. This information could if useful be sent back to OpenMRS. OpenIMIS would produce a payment order for the various providers, and send back data per facilities to DHIS2. Future iterations and improvements (not part of this first prototype) will include the integration with iHRIS as to link services and health staff IDs, CERHIS as a complement to OpenMRS and adhering to the OpenHIE standard for health facilities.    </span></p><h3 dir="ltr"><span>C.

There isn’t yet an scalable open source health insurance data system that countries could adopt for managing these schemes We propose to rebuild a first claim management module of the existing OpenIMIS code base, but in a way that does not duplicate functions and features that are best supported by other global health digital tools (i.e. patient management, health facility management).  </span></p><ol start="2"><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>What this investment from Digital Square will specifically go towards.</span></p></li></ol><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Software development of the claim management module</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Development of a broader multi-stakeholder roadmap </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Begin the process of creating a community of users and software  </span></p></li></ul><h2><span><span><br /></span></span></h2><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Community Feedback</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>At the technical level, we think OpenIMIS should be run as an Open Source project where the steering committee would serve as the core advisors and help set the general direction. They would need to be complemented with a broad set of stakeholders who would focus on managing it as a product in a very transparent way (meetings with open notes, mailing list and roadmap/issues on a public platform like GitHub or Jira).</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The community would be asked to contribute ideas for new features and to flag bugs. Specifically, they would have a chance to vote on what matters most to them. The result will be a healthy mix between a consistent/coherent product and representation of a large set of users.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Even when the steering committee has to discuss technical issues, they should do so in the open to allow the broader community to understand the reasoning between the choices and the direction that the tool is taking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>R4D has already agreed to support this arm of the project initiative by bringing in their rich network of health insurance practitioners as well as by fostering a link with the JLN network thus making the most of already existing infrastructures to communicate and share the result(s).</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><br /></span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Use cases</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>As the maturity of the health systems in lower and middle income countries evolves, Ministries of Health begin to explore the application of health insurance platforms and approaches. Since every country finds itself in a different phase they face different challenges in the next phase. Here is a sample of the situations various Ministries and other health system players have expressed to Bluesquare and R4D over the course of the last 6-10 months.</span></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Countries like Benin or Burkina-Faso are about to launch requests for new health insurance instruments. For countries at an early stage of health insurance deployment, an open source digital instrument would be of obvious added value. </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Countries such as Senegal and Ivory Coast have expressed interest in cost-effective open source solutions for health insurance systems. Both countries have spent significant resources in proprietary based health insurance systems over the last years.   </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Countries that have existing national health insurance funds and DHIS2 platforms such as Ghana, Kenya, Morocco are spending ressources developing ad-hoc data exchange and interoperability. They could benefit from a broader and open investment in this space. Specifically, they would like to be able to share ideas and exchange with other countries implementing these kinds of initiatives.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>In Kenya where health insurance platforms are more developed, prominent NGO Population Services Kenya is organizing private providers in a network to more proactively engage with purchasers like the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) and several private health insurers. Doing so will contribute to the development of a well-functioning “mixed” (public and private) health system, enhance the provision of more widely accessible publicly-financed services, and reduce providers’ reliance on out-of-pocket fees and donor funds. An interoperable claims processing system to integrate, channel, and monitor payments to providers; source data for performance monitoring and planning of service delivery; and reduce inefficiencies from paper-based transactions will be critical for mitigating fragmentation in the health market and realizing the potential value of positioning ready networks of high quality PHC providers for UHC.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>In Nigeria, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) primarily enrolls federal civil servants and aims to expand insurance coverage for UHC by supporting the 36 states in the country in starting up social health insurance schemes to enroll public servants, vulnerable populations, and private sector employees. The NHIS is focused on developing a common ICT platform for states to use in order to transact with and monitor providers, access and warehouse data, and channel information between the state and federal levels.

It offers three key services: (1) inventory management (including forecasting and optimization), (2) remote temperature monitoring (of cold-chains), and (3) distribution management (including order and transportation management). Logistimo, as a hosted service, is currently deployed in 5 countries including India, Myanmar, Indonesia, Zambia and Uganda, covering over 25,000 health facilities managing vaccine cold-chains and/or reproductive health supply chains. Local partners including aid agencies (such as UN) or Ministries of health have achieved high availability (&gt;95%) at high data reporting rates [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2674382">1</a>], and have ensured good quality of storage conditions until the last-mile of the supply chain with real-time visibility and analytics. In India, for instance, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Government have leveraged the Logistimo platform effectively in the eVIN project to achieve high availability (&gt;95%) across all vaccines in &gt;20,000 last-mile health facilities, while also enabling data-driven policy changes leading to lowered costs [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/UNDPasiapacific/a-shot-in-the-arm-the-india-story-of-electronic-vaccine-intelligence-network-evin">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/undp-in-asia-and-the-pacific/how-smart-tech-is-changing-the-way-india-vaccinates-156-million-people-b7fe0330e0ff">3</a>].</p><p>Logistimo services are built on the principle of <em>bottom-up empowerment</em>, where both health facility workers and district officials (or supervisors) are empowered with mobile applications for inventory management and supply chain monitoring, respectively. The health workers at the facility, such as a pharmacist or nurse at a village’s Primary Healthcare Center (PHC), use a store management application called <em>Iota</em> to manage inventory, create orders with automatic recommendations of optimal quantities (using predictive optimization), and track delivery. In immunization cold-chains, health workers are also able to monitor the temperature of the vaccine refrigerators in real-time on their phones. District officials, such as the District Health Officer or District Immunization Officer, on the other hand, are able to monitor the entire supply chain in their geographical jurisdictions through easy-to-use dashboards and alerts on supply chain risks on a mobile application called <em>Pulse</em>. They are also able to recognize good performance and motivate the workforce through a “social” approach of “liking” well-performing stores (as done in social networking sites). In addition, in some places both critical and good performance events are streamed on a digital monitor (such as a wall-mounted television or digital monitor), which exerts “social” pressure to act. Enabling monitoring in easy to use ways – be it mobile applications or publicly visible digital monitors – have shown to improve availability to high levels [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2674382">1</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/UNDPasiapacific/a-shot-in-the-arm-the-india-story-of-electronic-vaccine-intelligence-network-evin">2</a>], achieve data quality quickly with a simple training model [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17300531">4</a>], while also driving timely actions within the supply chain to mitigate risks [<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/logistimo.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSjJ5UoJNxjzkU7VrXeTzX8JdEkQSOSw33FlCdUoVBSDxaVz1qclO4GcCSKVPpO_50Ug01MHDy96vtC/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">5</a>].</p><h3>Challenge</h3><p>At this time, Iota (store management) is being used in over 25,000 health facilities across the 5 countries, while the Pulse (supply chain monitoring) is being used in over 370 districts across 2 countries. The applications are available in 5 languages including English, Hindi, Bahasa, Portuguese and French. In spite of an initial training session, we find that users do not uniformly understand how to effectively use certain features of the application or follow standard operating procedures correctly. They are also not fully aware of the all the features in the application and their benefits. This is due to the fact that different users have different capacities or attention bandwidths, and there is churn of personnel in the system. A one-time, centralized training session does not effectively address these issues. It is expensive to repeatedly re-train personnel to sustain capacity at a high quality. Even if this is done, there is churn in human resources, and capacity has to be rebuilt in the new persons that arrive. All these contribute to degraded quality of service, which also leads to a less motivated workforce.</p><h3>Solution approach</h3><p>We intend to enable a scalable model for ongoing capacity development of last-mile workers using a combination of:</p><ol><li>Easy-to-use self-serve, e-learning service with video content that enables self-learning and capacity assessments.</li><li>Community interactions with peer co-workers, supervisors or experts through an online group accessible within their mobile applications, which offers a sustained high-touch support. Such a group enables one to ask or answer questions online, as well as share of best practices.</li></ol><p>Both of these will be made contextually accessible through the Iota and Pulse mobile applications that are already in use. The former enables deeper self-learning, while the latter enables ongoing learning through human mentorship that anyone in the community can offer online.</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Content sustainability</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">When relying on multi-media content, there is an additional challenge of </span><em style="font-size: 0.9em;">content sustainability</em><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">, wherein the content has to be evolved continuously as the application features or operating procedures evolve. This will require additional resources, time and cost, and there is a need for continuous investment. Secondly, any piece of content would have to be customized to different geographies, including language and captions, if closed captioning is used</span></p><p>We plan to enable <em>sustainable</em> content in a couple of ways:<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><ol><li>Optimize the content production process by addressing the structural design of content that maximizes learning while minimizing content maintenance. Concepts of <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/chunking-information/">information chunking using in e-learning design</a> will be leveraged in this context.</li><li>Provide a <em>content production toolkit</em> with a recommendation of self-serve production tools to produce or customize content, along with guidelines for good content design. With the evolution of video technologies, there is a proliferation of <a href="https://www.wowmakers.com/blog/explainer-video-software/">product explainer video tools</a>, for instance, that enable self-serve video creation, thereby reducing costs and time of production.</li><li>Enable a community of authors within our customer groups to collaborate and evolve content, as the application features and operating procedures evolve.</li></ol><p>Together, we expect these to enable sustainable online learning content that will be cost-effective to create, customize and maintain.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Proposed project</span> </h3><p>The proposed project aims to build and deploy the web services, mobile application and sustainable content required to enable cost-effective learning in a low-resource environments, with pilot in India.</p><p>In particular, it will involve the following:</p><ol><li>Software development and integration which would enable two services for self-learning and community support for ongoing capacity improvements. These include: (a) a multimedia, multilingual “self-learning content service”, integrated with the mobile applications to deliver contextual help and support to users, and (b) a “group messaging service” to enable users to interact online with their local community and experts to answer questions or share best practices.</li><li>Sustainable content development including procedures and self-serve tools for content organization and rich-media content.</li><li>Evaluation of capacity development using the proposed tools and methods through a pilot in India. </li></ol><p>The above services will have open APIs and any new code will be open sourced under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">GNU AGPL v3</a> license for use and evolution by the developer and implementation communities. The content production toolkit will also be offered for anyone who wishes to create or customize content. The learning from this project would be shared with the global community so that others could adopt similar practices and tools to empower health worker capacity in a scalable and cost-effective manner using mobile technologies.</p><p>We believe that the outcomes of this project would deliver concepts and practical artifacts that would strongly empower and motivate the last-mile workforce to perform better, leading to a higher quality of service<em>. Concepts and tools generated here can be used well beyond supply chain applications to any other digital health applications</em></p><p><span style="color: #f48024; font-size: 1.4em;">Consortium team</span></p><p>The consortium will include the following organizations with Logistimo being the primary.</p><p><strong>Logistimo</strong></p><p>The prime organization that will develop this service is <a href="http://logistimo.com/">Logistimo</a>.

Moodle is robust, has an offline mobile application as well as a desktop application, in addition to their web interface, that is sufficient for our learning and capacity assessment needs. It is feature rich and supports a wide-range of capabilities including multi-media, collaborative content authoring, activities around capacity assessment (such as quizzes), student recognition (e.g. badges), and so on. It is used by over 100 million users worldwide. The Moodle project itself is well-supported by an active <a href="https://moodle.org/dev/">international community</a>, a team of dedicated full-time developers and a network of Moodle <a href="https://moodle.com/partners/">certified partners</a>. This ensures that the software is continuously evolving for the better with <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases">major new releases</a> coming every six months. We will rely on the Moodle community for support, when needed.</p><p>NOTE: At this time, Moodle appears to be a strong choice, given its features, their new mobile application, its widespread use as well as a very active development community around it. As part of this project, we also plan to evaluate the mobile applications of <a href="https://digital-campus.org/oppiamobile/overview/">OppiaMobile</a> and <a href="https://chamilo.org/en/">Chamilo</a>, which are other open source e-learning applications.</p><h2>Project description</h2><p>Logistimo’s platform is built on the principle of <em>bottom-up empowerment</em>, which requires that every person in the human value chain – from the last-mile to the first-mile – be <em>empowered</em> to effectively manage performance of their stores or the supply chain networks in their respective jurisdictions. Empowerment in this context implies at least the following:</p><ol><li>They have sufficient <em>capacity</em> and <em>support</em> to manage and perform well.</li><li>They have the required <em>data</em> and <em>analytics</em> to make good decisions.</li><li>They are able to <em>justify</em> their actions (in case it is questioned).</li></ol><p>Empowering workers at the last-mile, below district, is challenging due to the following reasons:<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><ol><li>Health workers at the last-mile service delivery points, such as a pharmacist/nurse at a PHC, may have limited knowledge of logistics and operating procedures. Their ability to use technology can also be limited.</li><li>District officials, such as a District Health Officer, may have limited attention bandwidth due to multiple responsibilities, frequent travel, limited support staff and limited use of computers or any other form of technology.</li><li>Within a given district, there can be non-standard procedures and practices around data recording and logistics, and poor coordination leading to lack of visibility and low quality of service, including stock outs and degraded storage conditions (esp. in a cold-chain).</li><li>The culture of data recording and usage is low in such environments, both at the last-mile facilities and at the district headquarters (such as the district health office). Even where data exists, the ability to analyze and act on that data is limited.</li></ol><p>Logistimo has developed and deployed a couple of mobile applications – Iota and Pulse – that can be consumed on smartphones by people managing a store or a supply chain network. <strong>Iota</strong> is used by health workers at last-mile service delivery points, to manage inventory and orders. It enables them to enter simple inventory transactions such as issues, receipts, discards and stock counts, while offering them real-time visibility of stock, alerts on low stock or expiry, optimal order quantity recommendations (based on predictive optimization), and transaction audit trails. This, in turn, empowers the health worker by enabling a relatively standard data recording mechanism, awareness of risks through timely alerts, easy-to-consume analytics for decision support and visible audit trails that are verifiable by anyone. <strong>Pulse</strong> is used by district officials, such as the District Health Officer or the District Immunization Officer, to monitor the supply chain using real-time dashboards (on inventory and storage conditions), review critical risk indicators, and recognize stores with consistently good performance using a “social” mechanism of appreciating them through “likes” (as done in Facebook, for instance). This empowers a district official, even with limited bandwidth, to relatively easily understand the current state of the supply chain, enable proactive actions through timely awareness of risks, and motivate the workforce by recognizing good performance. This, in turn, enables a higher quality of service and a more motivated workforce.</p><p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="../sites/default/files/u77/iota_and_pulse/index.png" alt="" width="609" height="600" /></p><p>Leveraging mobile applications for supply chain monitoring, including pro-active risk management and workforce motivation has shown to achieve strong adoption, with over 250 district officials using it on a daily basis, and has enabled timely, coordinated actions in the supply chains along with new practices for workforce performance recognition (enabled using the social “likes” feature) <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/logistimo.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSjJ5UoJNxjzkU7VrXeTzX8JdEkQSOSw33FlCdUoVBSDxaVz1qclO4GcCSKVPpO_50Ug01MHDy96vtC/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">[5</a>].</p><p>These applications are typically deployed through a centralized training process by aggregating relevant personnel at the district and using lectures, training documents and/or offline videos as part of the training session. After the training, application usage and data entry of health workers is monitored, and district officials offer phone-based support, wherever necessary. However, there are a few challenges in ensuring sustained capacity to use the applications and following standard procedures to ensure good service. These include:<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><ol><li>District officials tend to have low bandwidth due to multiple responsibilities or travel, then oversight and support is not available to the health workers.</li><li>If there is churn of personnel in the system, be it at the health facility or at the district headquarters, then new training is required to ensure business continuity, which is expensive on a per person basis.</li><li>As new features are rolled out, or operating procedures are changed, frequent re-training of personnel is expensive and not possible due to budget constraints. </li></ol><p>To address the above challenges, we propose a hybrid model of sustained capacity building using a combination of (a) self-learning through audio/video help and (b) an online community forum comprised of health workers, district officials and experts/technicians in the same district, both of which are accessible through their mobile applications. The self-learning content enables deep learning, while the community forum helps resolve queries and share best practices on inventory and logistics management.</p><p>Further, given the demographic spread across countries, each country or supply chain may require customizations to the content, including language of the audio, branding, or captions. The solution approach will explore a sustainable model of content creation and maintenance that will ensure faster and cost-effective customizations of the videos.</p><h3>Technical approach</h3><p>The approach to the problem of sustainable capacity building is three-fold:</p><ol><li>Enable a <em>Self-learning content service</em> that allows one to publish rich-media content, including text, audio and video consumable in HTML or other standard formats that can be rendered on a mobile application and/or a web browser. A standard, open source Learning Management System (LMS) will be leveraged for enabling this.</li><li>A <em>Group messaging service</em> that includes peers (say, all health workers in a given district) or experts, which enables them to seek local community support through their mobile application. This would be similar to a Whatsapp group, where users can post questions and comments (along with pictures) and others can respond to it. This would enable people to clarify their understanding as well as share best practices, thereby supporting a self-learning approach with a high-touch human experience. This, we believe, could be a scalable model for sustained capacity building.</li><li>A <em style="font-size: 0.9em;">Content production toolkit</em><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> that enables a sustainable </span><em style="font-size: 0.9em;">content production process and tools</em><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> that helps one to generate or customize quality content in a cost-effective manner. There are two aspects of content sustainability that we will consider in this phase: (a) maintainability of content, and (b) cost-effectiveness, esp. keeping in mind the need for customization across geographies and supply chains.</span></li></ol><div><strong>Self-learning content service</strong></div><p>The self-learning content service will enable publishing and retrieval of text, audio or video content, to help the user achieve specific supply chain goals using the mobile applications and the relevant operating procedures. The content could be in the form of usage guides, FAQs, operating procedures, or troubleshooting guides. A community of geographically spread out logistics professionals already familiar with the applications can be authorized customize or publish content in localized languages, with an approval process to assure content quality. This will enable us to support deployments in multiple geographies in multiple languages in a scalable manner, while enabling local customizations. The content should be <em>contextually</em> accessible through the respective mobile phone applications (of Iota and Pulse), optimized in size to be downloaded or streamed on 2G mobile networks and allow offline usage in low or no network areas.</p><p>To enable this, the following services will be enabled and integrated into the mobile applications:<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><ol><li>A backend publishing service that enables one to publish text, audio or video content along with the context of their use. Permissions on who can publish what type of content along with moderation controls will be enabled to ensure quality. This could be an existing learning management system, which offers APIs for integration.</li><li>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) within our system for accessing such content on our mobile applications.</li><li>Features in the mobile application to retrieve and display such content in the context of feature usage.<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></li></ol><div><p><a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>, an open source learning management system, appears to satisfy our needs in this context, and is currently the primary software candidate based on our evaluation at this time. The <a href="https://moodle.com/moodle-app/">Moodle mobile application</a> offers a host of features for content consumption, activities (such as quizzes) and capacity assessments of its users. It also offers applications on desktops and Surface tablets, along with a <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Moodle_app_synchronization">mechanism to synchronize data</a> entered in offline (no network) mode.</p></div><div>At this time, Moodle appears to be a reasonable choice for the kind of requirements that we have, based on our own initial research, as well as market research of the top 10 open source learning management systems [<a href="http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/sep2016/A-Survey-Of-Top-10-Open-Source-Learning-Management-Systems.pdf">6</a>].</div><div> </div><div><strong>Group messaging service</strong></div><p>The group messaging service is an ‘online group’ accessible from the mobile applications, similar to a Whatsapp group, but with topical organization of conversations. Users can post questions, answer questions or share their learning or best practices with each other. The messages can be against a topic, and content can include text, photo or audio. Users can join one or more relevant groups to interact. In the absence of supervisory bandwidth, this enables any knowledgeable person in the group to respond to questions or guide users who need help. It thereby enables a virtuous cycle of sharing and learning that further improves the capacity of individuals and the community as a whole. Posts can be “liked” (as done to Facebook posts, for instance) or “marked helpful” (as in help forums). Such signals can further be used to identify “competent” community members, and perhaps incentivize them to continue such support. In a similar vein, any abuse can be filtered out through a combination of community reporting and automated filters. This, in turn, leads to a high quality community support system that offers mentoring and sharing of best practices, thereby enabling the process of sustained capacity building.</p><p>This service will manifest in the form of a web service, and will offer relevant APIs for the mobile applications or other services to integrate this feature. This service will be built as a new web-based, micro-service with REST APIs, as part of the Logistimo platform. The source code will be made open under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">GNU AGPL v3</a> license.</p><p><strong>Content production toolkit</strong></p><p>The content toolkit enables a way for authorized personnel in the user community to produce or customize content using a set of recommended tools, guidelines and existing content resources available in a repository. The content production process will be designed with sustainability of content in mind.<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><p>In particular, the toolkit will address the following:</p><ol><li>Guidelines for effective <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/chunking-information/">information chunking</a> to design content in a manner that is optimal for both e-learning and content maintenance. Chunking will also ensure that changes to features or workflows in one part of the application will not impact the others. This should minimize effort of content maintenance, while maximizing learning objectives. Guidelines for chunking will be published. <em>Further research will be required in this project to determine the most optimal strategy for learning content chunking</em>.</li><li>An optimal content production process that leverages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing">audio mixing</a> to mix audio into video, thereby enabling easier customization of videos. Video and audio content will be recorded separately and mixed together later on. This would enable one, for instance, to simply replace the audio in a new language while keeping the video as is, or add captions in another language. A searchable content repository of the constituent video and audio components in different languages would be made available, say, using the LMS repository or Google docs or similar repository. Through this process, we hope enable a cost effective process of customizing content for different language contexts.</li><li>Self-serve, rich-media content development tools, which will allow one to create or customize content themselves using guidelines and best practices. <a style="font-size: 0.9em;" href="https://www.wowmakers.com/blog/explainer-video-software/">Explainer video creation tools</a><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> will be evaluated and recommendations will be made for others to use. This will reduce production costs significantly compared to conventional, outsourced video production for such purposes.</span></li></ol><div>The content toolkit will be opened to the community of users, including a the searchable content repository, guidelines for cost-effective production and customization, and a recommendation of video editing/mixing tools.</div><div> </div><h3>Deployment and evaluation</h3><p>Once the application features are developed, it will be deployed in pilot mode in the immunization supply chain in select districts in India with support from UNDP to evaluate the effectiveness of the service. In particular, the adoption of the content/features by users and their effectiveness in building sustained capacity will be evaluated. Worker’s knowledge acquisition will be evaluated through scores on quizzes and could be correlated to improved inventory performance in the supply chain. Learning from the pilot will be published and the features/model will be fine-tuned to make them more effective. This will be shared with the broader global health community in the interest of enabling bottom-up empowerment and capacity building in similar contexts elsewhere.</p><h2>Use cases and user stories</h2><p>Use cases and user stories by actor are described below.</p><h3>Actors</h3><p>The key actors in this system include the following:<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><ol><li><strong>Health workers</strong> in health facilities at the last mile, as well as warehouse managers at the district or above, who use the Iota application for store management.</li><li><strong>Supervisors</strong> or officials at a district or above who are using the Pulse application for monitoring the supply chain.</li><li><strong>National Training Administrator </strong>at the National or State levels who are responsible for training and may customize content to their respective languages and terminologies.</li><li><strong>Content managers</strong>, typically from Logistimo or an organization authorized by Logistimo, create and manage the content for e-learning of features and operational procedures.</li></ol><h3>Health worker</h3><p>A health worker is responsible for managing inventory in the health facility at the last-mile or at the higher level warehouse (such as a district warehouse).</p><p><strong>Use case</strong></p><p>A health worker is typically at the last mile health facility and is responsible for managing inventory optimally at the facility.

Strathmore University in collaboration with other implementing partners have developed  an open source Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) that was configured primarily for specimen, testing and test results management supporting  functionalities such as lab test equipment  interfacing  and electronic data transmission to other systems(e.g. EMRs) to reduce manual workload, decrease turn-around times, and improve quality control, and documentation to meet internationally-recognized laboratory standards and improve quality of laboratory specimen testing.</p><h3>The BLIS 3.0 Technology</h3><p>The Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) project, is an open source Web-based system that can be installed in a local, district, or national laboratory. It is a tool that can help to standardize data, track the specimen/test workflow and improve the ability to generate useful reports and can both give a realistic picture of laboratory services and assist with staff and budget planning. With enough data, BLIS can be used to track disease surveillance and response over time. BLIS has incrementally improved based on the user feedback and now is moving to the new release of Ver. 3.0</p><p>Features of BLIS include:</p><ul><li>One-time entry of each unique patient and specimen detail. </li><li>Workflow specimen management including test results verification and reporting</li><li>Standardization of data collected (allowable entries for specimen type, test type, patient data, reagents)</li><li>are set at Ministry of Health (MOH) level and then entered consistently throughout a country)<ul><li>Customization to a country’s needs</li><li>Ability to track lab supplies such as test kits, reagents and inventory</li><li>Ability to run reports as specified by a country</li><li>Automatic alerting of data values that may be out of range(reference ranges and panic values are set at the regional or national level</li></ul></li></ul><p>BLIS has been successfully implemented in 2 county level hospital laboratories in Kenya with ongoing implementations in 10 district/regional laboratories in Uganda. This implementation experience and proof of concept has resulted in emerging interest and requests for technical support from a number of countries including Swaziland, Mozambique and Nigeria. We have also developed a growing community of BLIS users including developers, implementing partners, lab managers and technologists and the ministries of health stakeholders.</p><h2>Our Approach to long term sustainability</h2><p><span>This proposal is a request to support the scaling and building of local in-country capacity to sustainably support BLIS 3.0(the upgrade) implementation to laboratories in Africa.</span></p><p>The Scaling of the BLIS project will require as part of long term objective of sustainability and retaining local ownership an Active Participatory Approach involving all the stakeholders. The key stakeholders in the Scaling are the BLIS Community comprising of the core developers, implementers, lab users and the hospital/country administration and partners.</p><p>The implementation and participation will be based on the following key objectives.</p><p>1)      Developing and strengthening of the in-country technical capacity through the establishment of the “BLIS Academy” to focus of developing both offline and online training resources targeting various categories of the BLIS user community. This means the BLIS community will have access to co-create resources for the development and scaling of BLIS.</p><p>2)      Strengthening the development of the BLIS 3.0 core modules to support a wide ranges of workflows, services, tests and specimen referral support. This will target the core development community of the technical teams in the respective countries.</p><p>3)      Support the BLIS 3.0  integration to more laboratory testing equipment and data exchange with other systems.</p><p>4)      Provide technical support to the BLIS 3.0 user community and drive the expansion of the community through a well-defined communication strategy.</p><p> <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">The community engagement will be based on the Agile Systems Development Methodology. Agile Development is an umbrella term for several iterative and incremental software development methodologies. Agile development methods are characterized by the short period generally 1-4 weeks in which software is developed. These periods are called iterations and can be considered sub projects that deliver something operational at the end of the period.</span></p><p>The full details of the proposal and  implmentation plan are provided in the supporting documentation</p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Tagging: LIMS, Laboratory Information Systems, Interoperability, Diagnistics and Testing, Specimen Tracking, System Intergration</span></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-proposal-status field-type-list-text field-label-inline clearfix"><div class="field-label">Application Status:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> Approved - partially funded</div></div></div>

It was founded, developed, and researched in East Africa since 2005. It’s a mobile health (mHealth) solution linking patients and providers, utilizing text messaging via </span>short-message<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> service (SMS), with voice calling (and now video where appropriate) support, to communicate </span>health related<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> issues from the patient’s perspective. It provides regular check-ins with outpatients and offers real-time, needs-based sorting of responses, and is a secure housing for patient-level data. Moreover, WelTel helps care providers better understand and respond to the needs of their patients while in the community. This interactive outpatient care approach distinguishes WelTel from simple texting platforms since its unique approach enables enhanced </span>holistic<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> care of patients, rather than a simple messaging service </span>add on<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">.</span></p><p>Since its inception, the development and refinement of WelTel has followed the directives of enhancing access, building equity, and saving lives. It offers greater applicability across disease-categories, populations, and geographies by utilizing more ubiquitous infrastructure (mobile penetration, accessibility of mobile units, &amp; low-cost SMS) to enable clinics to “reach the unreachable”; it was one of the first mHealth initiatives proven to improve patient health outcomes in clinical trials (increased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), higher quality of life scores, increased antenatal clinic attendance (ANC), and greater number of skilled birth attended deliveries in northern Kenya).The evidence generated from WelTel’s proof-of-concept studies has informed many other programs and international guidelines. Importantly, the WelTel technical service internalizes the learnings from the extensive research by its partners and others into its own product features, ensuring it leads with evidence-based best practices. Much of the research conducted on WelTel and its services has been published in top tier and open access journals. Program level health system data captured by the WelTel system belongs to the health service providers and authorities responsible to their populations, with appropriate data sharing agreements for research and quality improvement initiatives.  <strong>The global relevance of WelTel has amplified</strong>, as a viable solution for low-resource health delivery systems that also offers an ability to integrate with emerging health system technologies (i.e. EMRs, HIMS) as they are increasingly available in lower and middle income countries (LMIC).</p><p><strong>With a focus on reciprocal learning and continual software refinement across continents, WelTel maintains versatility to meet unique health system needs.</strong> WelTel’s application in managing infectious disease in developing countries (e.g. HIV, TB) is paralleled with its emerging use in chronic disease self-management (e.g. asthma, diabetes mellitus). Within East Africa, countries like Ethiopia and Kenya are dominant leaders in mHealth integration into their health service delivery. While the willingness to adopt mHealth solutions as complementary strategies for health service delivery is high, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the scale-up and wider adoption</span>, especially in countries with less experience and fewer resources, has been low. <strong>Necessary next steps for mHealth in East Africa includes knowledge exchange, coordination, and strategic regional collaboration within and across countries to improve scalability</strong> (Lee, Cho, &amp; Kim, 2017).</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>Originating in Kenya, WelTel has a growing global presence with demand for projects now expanding in Canada, the USA, Belgium, and South Africa which is facilitating the core technology feature development and base for a sustainable business model. However, as WelTel continues to grow in East Africa, with new projects launched in Rwanda, Ethiopia and Uganda, there are multiple challenges we face that hinder our ability for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sustainably and timely growth, including</span>:</p><ul><li>The lack of<strong> strategic regional collaboration. </strong>Many of the mHealth services offered in this region are still in pilot phase and struggle with scale-up over the long-term (known informally as <em>pilotitis</em>) (Huang, Blaschke, &amp; Lucas, 2017). Although WelTel preceded the influx of pilots, WelTel’s expansion has also faced small level deployments. However, WelTel is considerably well-positioned for expansion, given its continued use, institutional knowledge from a history of iteratively overcoming challenges, and cross-cutting competitive advantages to alternate approaches that remain today - (see Community Feedback for developments around WelTel’s sustainability). Unfortunately, many organizations repeat facing the same challenges and may waste valuable time relearning lessons already learned by others. Only with strong intraorganizational and interorganizational collaboration, including exchange of best practices and knowledge between existing mHealth services in East Africa, will there be an efficient environment for scaling.</li><li>The <strong>lack of integration with other health system infrastructure</strong>, including electronic medical records(EMR) or HMIS. Many facilities currently using WelTel to assist in care delivery in East Africa still rely on paper charting, while others have an EMR where patient data is input either real-time or from charts after clinical visits. Since WelTel is primarily used for improving the front-line patient care experience and improving health indicators (ANC visit attendance, facility births, immunization uptake, reduced HIV/TB defaulter rates etc) and can be used as a standalone digital service, it can be used in adjunct with both paper and EMR charting, and the key indicators are captured by the existing systems. However, the WelTel platform also offers an opportunity to strengthen data capture quality, and capture data that is missed or unavailable by traditional medical records that exist only at the health facility level. For example, if a pregnant woman has a complication and dies in the community without reaching hospital, this information may not be captured in the facility level EMR, leading to under-reporting. In addition, because many individual patients access several different health service providers for various aspects of their care, due to mobility or differential value seeking, patients registered in WelTel remain their with their unique identifiers and contacts which can be used to harmonize different facility level data sources. For those facilities that have adopted EMRs, ensuring quick integration could offer time and cost savings in data exchange at the facility and national levels. Because WelTel is easy to adopt, it can also act as a bridge to more comprehensive EMR and HMIS adoption, sensitizing remote communities and facilities to digital services.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Despite its extensive evidence-base and development of a viable digital health outreach platform service, implementation at scale remains too slow to ensure global best practices are attained.</strong> Our own research determined the extensive potential for current implementation of SMS-based mHealth programs for MNCH in remote communities (REF) which directly aligned with a government sponsored assessment of the digital health landscape in Kenya. In a recent USAID program officer visit to northern Kenya’s Afyaplus program, the officer called it a ‘game changer’ since no other digital health technologies were able to work in the area. For this application, theDigital Square financial resources and partnerships will be used to strengthenWelTel’s ability to <strong>enhance, expand, and sustain mHealth services in East Africa </strong>in alignment with health system and population health priorities.</p><h3>Core Activities</h3><p>We will enhance the regional scale up of WelTel through activities that foster sustainability by breaking down silos (knowledge exchange, collaboration), that capitalize on existing infrastructure (enhancements to software), lobby for investments by the telecommunication sector, government, and non-governmental organizations (collaboration, global relevance), and integrate health system technologies (interoperability, open sharing). In summary, activities will contribute to <strong>Building Regional Collaboration &amp; Exchange </strong>and/or <strong>Technology &amp; Integration Enhancements</strong> within a 2-year timeframe (2019 - 2021).</p><p><strong>A. Regional Collaboration &amp; Exchange</strong></p><ol start="1"><li><strong><em>Creation of a Physical Hub/Headquarters (HQ):</em></strong>A regional headquarters will be developed in Kenya to serve as the administrative host for regional implementation. Core staff will be hired as well as a Regional Coordinator to liaise with country level programs and programs outside of Africa.</li></ol><p>Core Activities (30%):</p><ul><li>Expand WelTel Kenya Office (HQ Nanyuki which is strategically located with access to Nairobi’s tech hub and the remote northern communities currently using the service)</li><li>Hire East African Regional Coordinator &amp; Administrator (admin assistance)</li><li>Expand office infrastructure (e.g. hardware)</li><li>Country site visits by Regional Coordinator (Y1: Kenya to Ethiopia, Rwanda | Y2: Kenya to Uganda, South Africa plus any new implementing countries)</li><li>Executive team visits (International, e.g. WelTel, 2Paths) for needs assessments, strategy, and administrative support.</li></ul><p>Key Outputs:</p><ul><li>In 2020, improved to administrative capacity and opportunities for collaboration for WelTel's sites with physical office space, hardware, and Regional Coordinator</li><li>Generated interest in WelTel for expansion within countries and beyond, including adoption or preludes to the adoption of eHealth strategies in these countries</li><li>Increase accountability and transparency to staff, stakeholders (e.g. health delivery systems) via visitations and timely reporting</li><li>Furthering investments internationally with recognition and physical point of contact - at least one new funder recruited</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong><em>Creation of a Regional Virtual Hub</em></strong>: In addition to creation of a physical office space with staffing to improve collaboration and exchange, a virtual hub offers a space for digital health organizations and key personnel in the health sector to communicate. It also extends the abilities of the Regional Coordinator and staff to troubleshoot and provide assistance in Kenya and other neighbouring countries where WelTel is used. There is flexibility in the design of a virtual hub based on stakeholder need, but its use to store and share documentation, and bring together knowledge holders (point of care) that really can assist one another in both implementation and delivery.</li></ol><p>Core Activities (20%):</p><ul><li>Establish an online communication platform for knowledge exchange</li><li>Identify each country representative(s). Includes standing country representatives as well as guest participants (such as key stakeholders or partners offering new ideas and contributions).</li><li>Hold monthly within-organization virtual meetings (discuss challenges, strategies, etc.) and quarterly meetings which can involve users &amp; external stakeholders</li><li>Offer operational assistance (technical and limited administrative support to country programs)</li></ul><p>Key Outputs:</p><ul><li>By 2020, have an online communication platform that is used by all countries (4) using WelTel in East Africa for general communication and exchange</li><li>By 2020, the Virtual Hub houses documentation and virtual meeting space for all countries (4+) and representatives using WelTel in Africa</li><li>Administrative processes (i.e. reporting templates, auto-fill forms) on Virtual Hub complete and adopted by all countries (4+) using WelTel in Africa</li><li>Approx. 2-3 digital health organizations in Africa invited into shared space, with pertinent documentation made available for capacity building and collaboration</li><li>By 2021, active engagement with a collaborative virtual hub including WelTel sites and collaborators to build capacity, troubleshoot, streamline admin duties, and create open data exchange.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong><em>Marketing &amp; Business Development: </em></strong>Although WelTel’s customer base is increasing in North America and Europe, development of a sustainable revenue stream for expansion, ongoing support, and future development in LMIC remains a challenge. As country economies improve in the region, there is an increasing shift toward donor independence. For example, in Kenya, County governments have devolved health funding to select health investments most appropriate for their setting and population. Affordable interventions that can improve health outcomes are being sought. In some of the poorest areas, however, donor investments an essential component of health system strengthening and are secured as part of local and national government collaborations and guidance. To date, WelTel has relied largely on individual level partnerships through demand and convenience rather than a broad marketing strategy. Opportunities include adoption by public and private health providers. In part of its transition from research into global implementation, WelTel requires additional resources to market itself as a premier service provider in the region.</li></ol><p>Core Activities:</p><ul><li>Development of a regional scale-up strategy</li><li>Seek new opportunities for scale-up (customers, funding, integration, sustainability) within East Africa</li><li>Develop and deploy marketing materials (For conferences, trade shows, direct stakeholder and customer engagement, and online and social media presence.)</li><li>Seek opportunities for expansion beyond East Africa (e.g. Southern and West Africa)</li><li>Provide reports and analytics on scaling process within East Africa (and share within hubs)</li></ul><p>Key Outputs:</p><ul><li>By 2020, a written strategic plan for regional scale up (4+ countries, 20%+ entities metrics). This will be a living document that updates over the course of the 2 years.</li><li>An inventory of partners and customers existing and in the pipeline. Developed by 6 months and updated quarterly with Hub meetings. </li><li>Coordinated marketing materials targeted to the region. E.g. Posters, banners, newsletters, collections of published articles and evidence, and an active online presence including social media.</li><li>Analytics and annual reports for funders, investors, and use in further marketing. </li><li>By end of 2021, have at least 1-2 expansion projects within existing WelTel countries and 1-2 scale-up projects in new countries</li></ul><p>B. Technology &amp; Integration Enhancements</p><ol start="4"><li><strong><em>Data &amp; Health Systems Integration: </em></strong>We seek to understand and coordinate shared needs in health informatics integration at a regional level (e.g. integration into clinical settings with and without EMRs and into national and regional HMIS). The WelTel clinical service platform is already developed to include the various clinical settings including for multiple health conditions and will continue to have its development and support funded elsewhere. Ideas for clinical feature development, however, will continue to be captured during the Hub interactions. The core technology development that will be supported by this Digital Square application is to determine and develop the optimal data capture and integration strategies for the local health facility users (e.g. EMRs) as well as the higher level HMIS (e.g. DHIS2). WelTel has currently developed several data sharing agreements with implementing partners; however, additional resources will be required to ensure a clear pathway to Open Data sharing from its applications in LMIC. A clear strategy and documentation of data sharing processes and procedures will be essential to the broader adoption of WelTel’s services into the health informatics ecosystem.</li></ol><p>Core Activities:</p><ul><li>Landscape analysis of EMR and HMIS in each country</li></ul><p>○       Identify major EMR deployments and alignment with WelTel services.  Consultation with government and collaboration partners.  A few key EMRs have been identified (e.g. OpenMRS [Kenya, Rwanda]) are examples but multiple individual facility and implementing organization level EMRs are also in use.</p><p>○       Investigate and document potential information flows between WelTel and EMRs, with alignment to national DHIS 2 flows through consultation with government, collaboration partners and technical staff.</p><ul><li>Develop coordinated strategic plan for WelTel and EMR/HMIS integration</li></ul><p>○       Depending on country context and working with collaboration partners and technical staff, develop an integration plan to implement the information flows form WelTel to facility EMR and/or national DHIS 2 implementations.  As an example Rwanda will likely require integration of several services using the Rwandan HIE, whereas Uganda and Ethiopia are earlier in their adoption of reference architectures such as OpenHIE and may benefit from more direct integration with facility EMRs.</p><ul><li>Begin development of Open Data and Data sharing standards</li></ul><p>○       WelTel currently supports access to it’s datastores via API and through simple to use full or select data exports.  However as part of the strategic plan, country requirements and integration with the broader HIE community we will evaluate which standards WelTel will implement, following the core tenets and recommendations from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/use-open-standards-open-data-open-source-and-open-innovation/">Principles for Digital Development</a></span>.</p><p>○       Begin development of WelTel data interoperability development workstreams:</p><p>■       We anticipate at least two initial WelTel modules adhering to IHE standards - a FHIR module for communication with OpenMRS and an ADX module for direct aggregate data exchange to DHIS 2.</p><p>■       Development will be done using agile methodologies and with a user-centered design process.</p><p>○       Development of documentation</p><p>■       There is opportunity to provide a public website that indicates how WelTel plays in the broader ecosystem, and more specifically with OpenMRS/DHIS2/OpenHIE. The configuration and mapping between each of these entities, so as to line up and share data, can be disseminated in an open format.</p><p>Key Outputs:</p><ul><li>By month 3 a landscape of existing and priority EMRs for developing data integration, to be updated at quarterly meetings.</li><li>By month 6 have a draft coordinated strategic plan for EMR/HMIS integration, finalized by end of Y1.</li><li>By the end of the first year, have Open Data and Data sharing standards documented and publicly posted</li><li>By end of Y2, have fully developed data interoperability works streams for WelTel and each country partners top EMR and HMIS (DHIS2).</li></ul><p>Given the critical time point for investment in this sector in collaboration and interoperability initiatives, as a social enterprise existing in multiple countries, WelTel will be positioned as a use-case leader in <strong>East African mHealth reform, </strong>where considerable efforts must be made to advance targeted evidence-based services into practice while recognizing the need to meet data sharing and informatics requirements in the region.</p><p>2.  <strong>Digital Health Technologies</strong></p><p>There are a number of mature digital health technologies involved which will be used in 3 deployment scenarios.  No changes outside of configuration will be made to OpenMRS, DHIS 2 and corresponding OpenHIE-related Components and Interoperability layer.  WelTel will include new modules for FHIR and ADX, with the specific domains and mappings aligned to the OpenMRS implementation.  Partner and government requirements will dictate which resources and actions are ultimately implemented, but will likely include certain events related to person, patient, provider, location, encounter and observation with the possibility for diagnostic report (laboratory).</p><ol start="1"><li>WelTel bi-directional with OpenMRS, federating to DHIS 2 via existing aggregation pipelines:</li></ol><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><ol start="2"><li>WelTel to DHIS 2 directly via ADX:</li></ol><p align="center"><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><p> </p><ol start="3"><li>WelTel via OpenHIM to OpenMRS, DHIS 2 and corresponding OpenHIE Component Layer infrastructure:</li></ol><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Digital Health Atlas:</h3><p>Registration with the Digital Health Atlas is in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://digitalhealthatlas.org/app/154/maps/0/0">http://digitalhealthatlas.org/app/154/maps/0/0</a></span></p><h3>Work Plan, Project Deliverables, &amp; Schedule</h3><p>For our full work plan and schedule of proposed activities, alongside key outputs and the associated Global Goods Maturity Model (GGMM) indicators, please see the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Wr4DzvBYp91CilaLZ5S90iKKEB5TWq3-qb4JSseU1c/edit#gid=1514951836">Gantt chart here</a></span><strong>.</strong></p><p>We assessed WelTel using the GGMM as per its present state and deployment in East Africa (Global Utility, 4/10; Community, 5/10; Software, 7/10).</p><p>WelTel ranked high for the Software core indicator, while Global Utility and Community indicators ranked lower. WelTel was designed and refined with interoperability, privacy and security principles in mind; the software is in version 3 and significant strides have been made in its usability across geographies and populations. However, strategies, documentation, and engagement with the user community requires strengthening. Digital Square offers funding for more targeted action within the Global Utility and Community core indicators, while still improving upon the software and it’s interoperability in these countries.</p><p>We assessed WelTel using the GGMM at the end of 2 years of funding, assuming completion of core activities listed in the work plan (Global Utility, 7/10; Community, 7/10; Software, 9/10). For each core indicator, the following sub indicators are directly addressed by one or more activities:</p><ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global Utility:</span> Country Strategy (Low to Medium), Country Utilization (Low to Medium), Funding &amp; Revenue (Medium to High) </li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community:</span> Developer, Contributor, &amp; Implementor Community Engagement (Medium to High), User Documentation (Medium to High)</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Software: </span>Scalability (Medium to High), Interoperability &amp; Data Accessibility (Medium to High)</li></ul><p>We will request two years of funding to end by January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Setting up of the regional hub office and hiring of key staff will occur in the first 3 months. Agreements with relevant partners will occur in the first 3-6 months. Key additional software feature development will initiate in the first 6 months and continue throughout the project period. Completion of the MNCH and TB specific modules as minimum viable products will occur in the first year and be tested and refined until the end of the project period. Business development and marketing will begin in the first 6 months and continue throughout the project period. Development of the Open Data procedures, including WelTel data linkage with the local EMRs and DHIS2 will be completed by the end of the first year, with refinements in the second year.</p><p>Project milestones will be tracked according to a Gantt chart developed with the full proposal and we will utilize a results-based accountability and management framework (RBMF). Country specific enrolment goals in terms of: a) numbers of health facilities/clinics adopting WelTel services; b) numbers of patients (direct beneficiaries) enrolled; c) numbers of frontline personnel trained; d) numbers and amounts of revenue sources for sustainability; and e) adoption of new features and services (e.g. video for TB, key indicator reporting modules linked to the DHIS2) will be monitored. We will also conduct budget impact assessments and model outcomes in terms of lives improved and lives saved.</p><h1>2-Sentence Overview:</h1><h3>Global Good Description</h3><p>WelTel is already a leading evidence-based digital health tool to support outpatient management, patient-centered care, and improve key health indicators including among vulnerable populations in in lower and middle income countries (LMIC). Our global good involves developing an affordable quality digital health service that can be scaled to the furthest reach into the population to maximize the numbers of beneficiaries and to create data flow processes that help improve critical health information exchange.</p><h3>Digital Health Funded Activities</h3><p>Digital Square will fund activities that WelTel have previously found difficult to secure from other sources, but that will greatly improve WelTel’s ability to scale-up and strengthen health systems in East Africa and beyond. These include creation of an East African headquarters and hiring of a regional coordinator; 2) establishment of a regional virtual communication hub to share experiences, strategies, and documentation; 3) to enhance our regional marketing and sustainable business development for scale up; and 4) develop critical health data sharing processes and standards for integration into the broader health information system in each country setting.</p><h1>Community Feedback</h1><p>Feedback from the Community will not be summative in nature, but rather formative.</p><p>In alignment with the Principles for Digital Development, we will be <strong>partnering with users &amp; stakeholders throughout the process of development</strong> (Design with the User) and we will be conducting ongoing <strong>assessments of the existing ecosystems of each country and health service delivery system</strong> (Understand Existing Ecosystems). The context in which WelTel is used varies even within countries and is fluid in nature. The local complexities and nuances, and the positioning of WelTel as a tool and the organization as a leader in regional collaboration, will need to be assessed and redefined over time.</p><p>The emphasis on building community through collaborative core activities ensures integrations of users and stakeholders in process evaluation. <strong>Establishing an online communication platform for knowledge exchange</strong>, for example, involves stakeholders in determining which platform is best to use based on local preference and ease-of-use for users that may be included in virtual hub activities &amp; collaboration. Creating <strong>strategic documents and sharing with the Community </strong>outlining processes for WelTel’s scalability and interoperability in Africa are examples of how the core activities will engage a local and broader audience.</p><p>We are mindful of the feedback that has already began during the co-creation phase of this application. Several helpful comments were made during this phase that we hope we’ve addressed in our application. We’ve reconsidered approaches and made sure to clearly define concepts that were seemingly elusive in our concept note, taking the opportunity to incorporate feedback at the onset, much like we would with feedback during the course of implementation. For answers to feedback from co-creation phase, see the Appendix.</p><h1>Cases &amp; User Stories</h1><table width="624" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="179"><p><strong>User type</strong></p></td><td valign="top" width="445"><p><strong>Case Examples (Stories)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="179"><p><strong>Patients</strong></p><p>(e.g. Pregnant women, children &amp; caregivers, HIV patients, TB patients, chronic diseases)</p></td><td valign="top" width="445"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical</span></strong><strong>:</strong> A pregnant pastoralist woman (real story) registered in WelTel gets a weekly text checkin asking how she is doing. She responds “shida” and a nurse calls her and finds the patient has a new headache. The nurse is concerned and instructs her to come to the clinic and helps arrange transport. On arrival she is found to have high blood pressure and is diagnosed with preeclampsia. She is treated and delivers a healthy baby. Both mother and baby survive (who might otherwise have died if delays in therapy).</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Informatics:</span></strong> Most government data collection systems exist at a facility level and may miss community events including complications and deaths. If this woman and baby died in the community they may not even be counted in the local or national statistics. WelTel provides a mechanism for knowing about and recording community level data that is essential for accurate data and statistics and to prevent underreporting.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips</span></strong><strong>:</strong> Even patients with poor literacy or with the most basic phones and intermittent cellular connections can participate by keeping the service simple (easy to use) and allowing shared usage (e.g. family and community members can represent others) ensuring the furthest reach and health equity.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Square Impact:</span></strong> 1) Through regional scaling larger numbers of pregnant women and patients enrolled in WelTel saves lives, improves key indicators, and makes community reporting of health events more accurate.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="179"><p><strong>Frontline health workers</strong></p><p>(E.g. nurses, clinical officers, counselors, community health workers)</p></td><td valign="top" width="445"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical:</span></strong> A busy nurse or community health worker is supporting over 1000 patients. By registering patients in WelTel the patients receive automated weekly text message checkins and other automated messaging (e.g. ANC and Immunization visit reminders, or chronic disease information) to ensure they can be supported should they have any complications or questions related to their care between visits. This has shown to improve both the quality and efficiency of HIV and MNCH care provided, since patients issues are addressed when they are needed rather than through more inefficient traditional clinic scheduled visits (supports <em>differentiated care </em>models). </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Informatics</span></strong><strong>:</strong> Because all SMS communications and notes are captured by the WelTel platform, patient histories can be stored and referred back to for clinical care and continuity, even if the health worker changes. Information such as Expected Dates of Delivery (EDD) in pregnancy can also flag which patients (e.g. expectant mothers) should be called for follow-up. Also, any laboratory or other test results (e.g. CD4 count or HIV load) or information can be provided to patients <em>in context</em> at any time. This occurs routinely in practice has been prefered to providing bare lab results which can be difficult for many patients to interpret.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips</span></strong><strong>:</strong> In rural and remote clinical and outreach settings where wifi or cellular data services are slow or nonexistent, the registering and following patients can be done completely by SMS commands. This method is fully integrated into the platform so that if a healthcare provider wishes to view the online platform for full functionality, they can do so anytime an adequate data connection exists. WelTel has run reliably in both busy urban and very remote settings with this method, which is unique and also supports health equity at the facility level since remote and smaller clinical settings can use the service.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Square Impact:</span></strong> Through scaling, regionally harmonized training, frontline health workers work becomes more streamlined for frontline providers and extends capacity for quality care and easier capture of community level health data.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="179"><p><strong>Health service providers</strong></p><p>(e.g. Government and private health facilities, health NGOs)</p></td><td valign="top" width="445"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical:</span></strong> Patient defaulters are a key problem to providing optimal care. WelTel is an evidence-based tool to improve treatment adherence, retention in care, and quality of life indicators. WelTel may assist health service provider organizations in achieving health indicator targets.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Informatics:</span></strong> WelTel collects data and provides a connection to patients who are registered even while in the community and between visits. In addition to helping improve key indicators as above, the WelTel data can be viewed or exported to supplement data in the facility based health information systems. Because it has an open API, data can be shared regardless of which health information system (e.g. EMR) is being used, if any.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips:</span></strong> In some settings, where performance based financing is in place, the WelTel service may assist programs in reaching key indicator targets and access additional funds.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Square Impact: </span></strong>Improved sharing of regional experiences makes implementation and scaling more efficient.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="179"><p><strong>Health system administration</strong></p><p>(e.g. Governments, Funders)</p></td><td valign="top" width="445"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> Governments and funders are responsible for services that improve the health of the population.
