National medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) use product registration as a mechanism for assuring the quality of pharmaceuticals and health commodities; however, the registration process is complicated and time consuming. When countries have weak medicine registration systems—backlogs of drug registration applications, inefficient drug testing systems, and incomplete data on suppliers and products—they can waste millions of dollars and put people at risk of using unsafe medicines.</p><p>Management Sciences for Health (MSH) has developed a web-based tool, Pharmadex, to help NMRAs streamline the process. Pharmadex is being used by four NMRAs to ensure that they have the most updated medicines available and approved for prescribing. We propose to add features such as multiple language support, user-configurable logos, and ability for each country to define their own fields and variables to ensure that NMRAs that have requested an application for use can easily adopt Pharmadex for their country contexts.</p><h2><strong>2.   Consortium Team</strong></h2><h3>Profile of Organization’s Relevant Qualifications</h3><p>MSH, founded in 1971, will lead software development. We have more than 30 years of experience with developing tools to facilitate pharmaceutical management functions, and we currently have eight electronic tools that address the different needs of pharmaceutical managers—from inventory management to treatment adherence tracking. Further information is available here:</p><p><a href="http://siapsprogram.org/tools-and-guidance/">http://siapsprogram.org/tools-and-guidance/</a></p><p><a title="MSH MIS Tools" href="http://siapsprogram.org/tools-and-guidance/" target="_blank"><img style="vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black;" src="../sites/default/files/u82/7_tools/index.png" alt="7_MSH_Tools" width="658" height="600" /></a></p><h3>Profile of Relevant Experience</h3><p>MSH is currently working to publish the tool source codes under an open source license and make it available to the public on GitHub. Some tools, including Pharmadex, need enhancements to maximize their effectiveness for the global eHealth community. To move this effort forward, we are teaming up with our previous software development partners. The international team will bring experience from the United States, Ukraine, Uganda, and the four countries that are using country-specific versions of Pharmadex to this initiative: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Namibia.</p><p><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="../sites/default/files/u82/4_countries/index.png" alt="4_Countries_Pdx" width="491" height="220" /></p><h3>Qualifications of Key Members</h3><p>MSH will serve as the prime and lead software development. We will be responsible for ensuring all objectives are achieved and all deliverables are developed by the stated deadlines.</p><p>The team will be comprised of the following individuals, who have successfully developed and customized Pharmadex in four countries. They have the expertise necessary to add features to Pharmadex to make it customizable for use in additional countries:</p><ul><li>Kim Hoppenworth, Pharmaceutical Software Specialist and Tester</li><li>Oleksii D. Kurasov, Consultant, Software Developer for both Phase 1 and 2</li><li>Kate Kikule, Medicines Registration and Inspection Specialist and Software Tester</li></ul><p>Please refer to <strong>Appendix A. CVs of Key Members</strong> for additional information on these individuals’ qualifications and experience.</p><h3>Number of Years in Operation</h3><p><strong>MSH</strong>, a global nonprofit organization founded in 1971, has 47 years’ experience in 150 countries working shoulder-to-shoulder with countries and communities to save lives and improve the health of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people by building strong, resilient, sustainable health systems.</p><h2><strong>3.   Project Description</strong></h2><p>MSH developed the web-based version of Pharmadex with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under the SIAPS program. We developed the system after assessing the availability of similar open source software within global eHealth, and not finding a product to meet identified needs. Electronic registration increases transparency and efficiency and facilitates the standardization of processes, which benefits the government, registration applicants, and most importantly, the public by expediting access to safe, high-quality medicines. Pharmadex is a fully auditable workflow and includes the following functionality:</p><ul><li>An administrator can configure and manage the system</li><li>An applicant (distributor or manufacturer) can submit and track an application or amendment</li><li>A coordinator can assign and track evaluations</li><li>An evaluator can evaluate and track evaluations</li><li>A regulator can approve, renew, suspend, or cancel a product</li><li>A health care user can search for and verify approved products</li></ul><p>Pharmadex complies with most of the Principles for Digital Development. Pharmadex has been:</p><ul><li>Designed with users from two continents and four countries</li><li>Developed based on the ecosystem in the different countries</li><li>Developed based on open source standards</li><li>Developed after an assessment showed that no FOSS alternative existed</li><li>Developed to ensure data security and privacy, such as through user roles</li></ul><p>Through this funding, we will enhance Pharmadex so that it is fully compliant with the Principles for Digital Development and will achieve the following:</p><ul><li>Easy scale up to NMRAs in other countries</li><li>Increased sustainability by incorporating the internationally recognized Common Technical Document (CTD) medicines registration procedures</li><li>Establishment of an international community around Pharmadex</li><li>Enhanced applicability</li></ul><p>MSH has already received requests from other countries that are interested in adopting Pharmadex. As more countries recognize the importance of a strong medicine regulatory system, especially registration, the availability of a generic version of Pharmadex will appeal to many countries. The existing country-specific (non-generic) version of Pharmadex is currently available as an open source application on GitHub, and a demonstration version is available here: <a href="http://pharmadex.msh.org/">pharmadex.msh.org</a>. The current version of the tool requires that countries make a lot of changes to adopt it efficiently, which is resource intensive. Our proposed generic version of Pharmadex will be readily available for installation and use and will also be available as an open source application.</p><div><h3>Technical Approach</h3></div><p>We will base the generic version of the application on our experience with the four existing country-specific versions and on a design that MSH developed that standardizes the registration procedure. We will add features such as multiple language support, user-configurable logos, and ability for each country to define their own fields and variables, for example, if they want to add a field for ISP mobile money in a country-specific format.</p><p>In addition to developing a generic version of Pharmadex, MSH will make additional enhancements depending on available funding:</p><ul><li>Development of a wholesaler inspection module</li><li>Interoperability with DHIS2</li><li>Information synchronization: health facility list from DHIS2 and then inspection results from Pharmadex</li><li>List of DHIS2 monitored medicines verified via synchronization with Pharmadex</li><li>Improved reporting tools, with a focus on user-defined reports and visualizations</li><li>Improved graphical user interface (GUI) focusing on improved usability (intuitive and logical flow)</li><li>Implementation of international clinical standards such as ICD-10</li><li>Creation of a platform for a Pharmadex support community</li><li>Inclusion of European Medicines Agency standards for pharmaceutical formulations: <a href="https://standardterms.edqm.eu/">standardterms.edqm.eu</a></li></ul><h2><strong>4. Use Cases, User Stories</strong></h2><p>Pharmadex has been developed and customized for four countries: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Namibia, all of which are highly appreciative of the system. With the implementation of Pharmadex in Mozambique, the average number of days to register a single medicine (from submission to final decision) decreased from 400 to 176 days over one year, which exceeded the project goals. Namibia reduced the medicine registration dossier backlog from 711 to 100 days in a year, reflecting an 86% improvement in process efficiency. Please refer to the following link to review details our success in Namibia: <a href="http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js21681en/">http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js21681en/</a></p><h2><strong>5. Digital Health Technologies</strong></h2><p>Pharmadex is a Java-based application built in Apache Web Service and MySQL relational database. The application can run on a desktop or an Android tablet/smart phone. The server can either be cloud based or run on a local Microsoft or Linux server. The software is available on the MSH GitHub site: <a href="https://github.com/MSH/Pharmadex">github.com/MSH/Pharmadex</a>.</p><h2><strong>6. Community Feedback</strong></h2><p>MSH and the core developers will use the existing GitHub platform to develop the code, which will open up the opportunity for digital health community members to contribute ideas. To further optimize the tool, we will get initial feedback from our existing country users and also reach out to new users from the countries that have requested the application about half-way through the project to assess their experience. We will also invite these users to test the application in the final stages of development.</p><div><h2><strong>7. Self-Assessment on the Global Goods Maturity Model</strong></h2></div><p>The self-assessment is available here: <a href="https://goo.gl/1sWS51">https://goo.gl/1sWS51</a></p><div><h2><strong>8. Digital Health Atlas</strong></h2></div><p>MSH is currently registered with the Digital Health Atlas under the name Kim Hoppenworth, <a href="mailto:khoppenworth@msh.org">khoppenworth@msh.org</a>.</p><h2><strong>9. Workplan and Schedule</strong></h2><p>Pharmadex links with and contributes to the World Health Organization Digital Health Interventions Framework under area 3.0 Health System Managers: “3.2.4 Register licensed drugs and health commodities.”</p><div><h3>Phase 1: Generic Version for Medicines Registration</h3></div><p>We have already designed the generic version (Phase 1) of the application to include a language module and ability for each country to define their own fields and variables. We will start the project by documenting the specifications for the development team. The development cycle is expected to be completed within 60 days, followed by 30 days of testing and documentation updates. After 90 days, we will add the generic version to the MSH GitHub open source repository.</p><p><em>Gantt Chart for Phase 1</em></p><p><img src="../sites/default/files/u82/gantt1/index.png" alt="Phase 1 Gantt" width="583" height="454" /></p><p><strong><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 1.2em;">Phase II: Enhancement with Inspection Feature</span></strong></p><p>Other changes (Phase 2) will depend on available funding. We propose to develop the wholesaler inspection module in Phase 2. The countries where we have implemented country-specific versions of Pharmadex have requested this functionality. This module could take up to six months to develop and implement. The analysis and design of Phase 2 will start once Phase 1 is in development; therefore, Phase 2 will be initiated during Phase 1.</p><p><em>Gantt Chart for Phase 2</em></p><p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/u82/gantt2/index.png" alt="Phase 2 Gantt" width="581" height="402" /></em></p><h3>M&amp;E Plan</h3><p>MSH has extensive experience working with monitoring and evaluation systems—especially under the USAID activity monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan framework. This ensures that proper indicators are developed and tracked appropriately to ensure quality on-time delivery.</p><p>MSH will choose progress indicators to track the development of the application’s new features and functionality. They will be as follows for each phase:</p><ol><li>Multiple language functionality available and tested</li><li>Inspection module available and tested</li><li>Country-specific system settings changed to be generic</li></ol><h3>Sustainability Plan</h3><p>During the project, MSH will set up a community page and also ensure that Pharmadex is available on the Digital Health Atlas. This will help implementing countries access a knowledge base created by other users and give easy access to all documentation needed.</p><h2><strong>10. Project Deliverables</strong></h2><p>We will provide the following deliverables for Phase 1:</p><ol start="1"><li>Database relational diagram/database map</li><li>Developers’ manual</li><li>Installation manual</li><li>User manual</li></ol><p>We will provide the following deliverables for Phase 2:</p><ol start="1"><li>SRS</li><li>Expanded database relational diagram/database map</li><li>Expanded developers manual</li><li>Expanded installation manual</li><li>Expanded user manual</li></ol><p>All source code material and documentation will be available on GitHub after both phases of the project.</p><div><h2><strong>11.

Automation of laboratory activities removes the element of manual reporting, increases productivity, and allows access to retrospective data for analysis.

This laboratory-diagnosis confirmation is critical to an appropriate and timely response to disease outbreaks. The challenge is how to ensure that disease confirmation information is available to all stakeholders who need this information in a timely manner. Many countries have or are planning on adopting a system like DHIS2 for disease surveillance<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" id="sdfootnote5anc"></a><sup>5</sup>. This means that both aggregate weekly disease case counts and individual case notifications can be managed and analyzed using DHIS2.</p><p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">To ensure that laboratory results information is available in a timely manner to all concerned parties, we propose designing and implementing the integration between the SENAITE and DHIS2. We aim to achieve this through the interoperability layer (IL) of the OpenHIE architecture. Interoperability between these two systems would reduce the burden on laboratory and other staff tasked with tracking down this information and entering it into multiple systems, and it would speed up the availability of laboratory results for response efforts. The disease surveillance functionality of DHIS2 is improving and given this more countries will likely look to use DHIS 2 for their disease surveillance data, reinforcing the importance of interoperability between DHIS 2 and laboratory information systems.</p><p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> <img src="../sites/default/files/u116/interoperability_layer_of_openhie_architecture/index.png" alt="" width="508" height="361" /></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span><br /></span>Illustration 1: Interoperability Layer of OpenHIE Architecture</em></span></p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 class="western" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc4078_3072861491" id="__RefHeading___Toc4078_3072861491"></a> Implementation of HL7 standards on Senaite LIMS</h2><p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> </p><p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Health Level-7 or HL7 refers to a set of standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various systems, in a healthcare context, should transfer clinical and administrative data between software applications of various healthcare providers.</p><p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Hospitals and other healthcare providers have different computer systems used from billing to patient tracking.

The core tenets of blockchain technology — a decentralized and encrypted way of distributing, sharing, and storing information — seem appealing for health data. In particular it offers the potential for distributed responsibility for the longitudinal and immutable storage of anything from open to hierarchically encrypted data sets.</p><p>One potential modality for quick innovation with blockchain technology is via its practical application as a means to provide immutable storage and audit logging as an addon to existing systems (for example, on a platform such as DHIS2). We propose leading a software R&amp;D effort to build a 3rd party escrowed data retention and retrieval solution for digital health application platforms based on distributed blockchain technology starting with DHIS2 as the first target platform.</p><h3>2 - Consortium Team</h3><p><strong>eSHIFT Partner Network is the prime organization for the project.</strong> It is a Swiss-headquartered not-for-profit association established to help great ideas scale into the national health systems of developing countries so that populations achieve better health outcomes.  At the core of eSHIFT is our network of commercial and non-commercial members with many years of expertise, providing strategic advice on, and implementation of, information management and digital health solutions to both national level and global-health bilateral actors. eSHIFT also hosts HISP Geneva, the Swiss node of the HISP network of global partners supporting the DHIS2 and improvement of health information systems in low and middle income countries.</p><p>eSHIFT has a number of projects currently underway in conflict zones, politically complex and/or resource constrained settings. The efforts documented herein, if made easy to use and accessible, could have very positive broad sustainable impacts to the successful ongoing operations of many country-level DHIS2 implementations.</p><p><strong>Entuura Ventures Ltd. (a founding eSHIFT member organization)</strong> is a consulting and engineering company incorporated in Belize. The company supports a variety of digital health information related multinational projects and activities. These projects involve supporting international multilateral organisations and key donors in the global health domain. Entuura has established a specialty practice in DHIS2 consulting, IT systems support and secure hosting. Entuura currently supports the University of Oslo HISP group in several country DHIS2 implementations, including more strategic work around IT security, mobile device management, systems administration and DHIS2 implementation governance.</p><p>We believe the following organisations will be engaged to participate in and augment the outcomes of this effort.  Each has already been approached (to various levels of endorsement/commitment):</p><ol><li><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">Major Technical University in Switzerland</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> which hosts a Decentralized and Distributed Systems Lab, a global leader in blockchain technology.  (This lab has software developers and blockchain subject matter experts) (to be announced in next phase of this process);</span></li><li><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">LogicalOutcomes.net</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> and their existing University affiliations having computer science resources with blockchain experience (software developers);</span></li><li><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">UiO/HISP</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> (core DHIS2 code) &amp; HISP Vietnam (DHIS2 API) as required for integration.</span></li><li><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">WHO / Health Data Collaborative (HDC).</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">  In particular the HDC affiliated ‘WHO/IER group working on WHO standards based DHIS2 addon applications’;</span></li><li>Any number of country MoHs (which we have existing relations) to inform this project;</li><li>Private sector actors working towards similar objectives  (e.g. <a style="font-size: 0.9em;" href="https://www.healthbank.coop/operational-team-2/"><span class="s2">Health Bank</span></a><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">, a Swiss based entity with </span><a style="font-size: 0.9em;" href="https://www.healthbank.coop/#about-us"><span class="s2">very complementary developed world focus</span></a><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> )</span></li></ol><h3>3  - Project description</h3><p><strong>Problem statement </strong><br />Digital health platforms such as DHIS2 have little or no intrinsic means for immutable data retention. Also, methods and means for securely encrypted offsite backups for disaster recovery or system auditability are too complex or generally elude the capacities for systems administrators to implement. Global public goods designed to improve the delivery and quality of these elements of platform operations are needed.</p><p>Blockchain technology now offers interesting potential in the health domain, in particular, associated with individual patient records. We propose an initiative which both addresses these technical challenges and explores whether blockchain technology may be a relevant and useful technology solution.<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </span></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong><br />One potential modality for quick innovation with blockchain technology is via its practical application as a means to provide immutable storage and audit logging as an addon to existing systems.  This could be useful in use cases for legal repudiation of fraudulent activity or tampering; think, for example, applications where medical evidence of war crimes is being gathered.  From a technical perspective, on a platform such as DHIS2, we could envision rapid short term benefits to include:</p><ol><li>A means to backup into a blockchain regularly reported health data offering a ‘forever’ record of health data sets which transcends changes in the underlying HIS system;</li><li>Backup and recovery of encrypted whole data sets within blockchain nodes which are the responsibility of entity(ies) outside the primary user.  Nodes could further be stationed at multilateral or bilateral agencies so that the “global good” of the data and its retention transcends the national government (be held by supra-national <a style="font-size: 14.4px;" href="http://www.un.org/en/ethics/pdf/convention.pdf"><span class="s1">legal structures such as those governing UN Agencies</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">);</span></li><li>For individual records, offer the potential for these records to have their (via DHIS2 Tracker Capture) data mirrored within the blockchain, with potential for access by other DHIS2 and digital health systems.  In effect, this works towards a “record per person in the blockchain”;</li><li>For managing sensitive records (e.g. <span class="s1" style="font-size: 14.4px;"><a style="font-size: 14.4px;" href="http://www.gbvims.com/">in association with</a> </span><a style="font-size: 14.4px;" href="http://www.unhcr.org/sexual-and-gender-based-violence.html"><span class="s1">SGBV</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">, conflict situations, migrant populations) encrypt and store digital artifacts immutably in the blockchain.  This opens possibilities for countries compliance e.g. </span><a style="font-size: 14.4px;" href="https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/primers/10-human-rights-priorities-for-the-ict-sector"><span class="s1">UDHR</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">, protection of women &amp; children (</span><a style="font-size: 14.4px;" href="https://www.unicef.org/media/media_94547.html"><span class="s1">Primero</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">);</span></li><li>For datasets where long term auditability is critical, leverage blockchain ledger to store checksum information against such datasets contained within DHIS2, thus offering assurance data has not been tampered since it was originally entered;</li><li>A means to capture standardised information. A prime example here would be vital events/civil registration (beginning where <a style="font-size: 14.4px;" href="http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/24th-anniversary-the-daily-star-part-2/health-sector-demonstrates-the-incredible-power"><span class="s1">MOVE is already implemented within DHIS2 e.g. Bangladesh</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">).</span></span></li></ol><p><strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Approach</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">This proposal covers the first two phases of a software project. The entire project, which is beyond the scope of this proposal, would consist of an R&amp;D effort to build a 3rd party escrowed data retention and retrieval solution for digital health application platforms based on distributed blockchain technology:</span></p><p><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">Phase 1: Specification (2 months)</strong></p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Develop a detailed <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/digital-health/target-product-profiles/en/"><span class="s2">Target Product Profile</span></a> for blockchain use in global digital health applications using the specific example of DHIS2 (as a 1st starting example))<em><br /></em></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Address blockchain <a href="https://medium.com/wearetheledger/the-blockchain-gdpr-paradox-fc51e663d047"><span class="s2">challenges of data security</span></a> and in particular data deletion (esp <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/"><span class="s2">GDPR</span></a>).<em><br /></em></span></li></ol><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (6 months)</strong></span></p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Developing the first <em>minimum viable product </em>to allow for e.g. complete and secure backup of DHIS2 data sets and/or auditable checksumming information in blockchain ledger;<em><br /></em></span></li></ol><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Phase 3: Additional features and applications (12-18 months)</strong></span></p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s3"><a href="../%20https_/www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/07/checking-the-ledger-permissioned-vs-permissionless-blockchains/index/index.html"><span class="s4">Building out a set of blockchain nodes</span></a></span><span class="s1"> across diverse actors in Switzerland, a jurisdiction wherein the regulatory environment around data confidentiality is trusted and robustly applied;<em><br /></em></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Developing one or more DHIS2 addon applications which would evolve over time to support the various objectives listed above.  In order of priority: <em><br /></em></span></li><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Audit logs of system changes within the blockchain stored as blockchain transactions;<br /></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add capability to store DHIS2 Tracker transactions as blockchain transactions;<br /></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">In future, expand to other, well used and supported, digital health systems (e.g. OpenMRS, OpenLMIS, OpenELIS, OpenSRP etc..<br /></span></li></ol><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Once more than one software is speaking via developed addon modules to our blockchain, begin looking at cross-cutting storage and retrieval of longitudinal individual records;</span></li></ol><p><strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">Resourcing and Proposed Timeline<br /></strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">We foresee the whole R&amp;D process (if it were fully funded) to take 18-24 months, and it would require work effort that is well beyond the scope of this grant alone.

Executive Summary</strong></h2><p>Absenteeism, or unscheduled absence from work, is a persistent problem in health facilities worldwide. The cause of absenteeism among health workers is multifaceted but the net effects are clear and highly disruptive to already-struggling health services. Most importantly, reduced numbers of staff result in diminished service provision and compromised service quality, as those health workers that do report to work are often overburdened with the tasks of their absent colleagues. This retards the ability of governments to achieve quality health outcomes for their citizens and reach goals like universal health coverage (UHC).</p><p>Tracking attendance, as part of a comprehensive package of performance management and retention strategies, can help decrease absenteeism and promote greater transparency and accountability in the health sector. In the spirit of trust but verify, biometric methods of identification and collection of attendance data can help ministries of health track if workers are on the job and how long they are working each day.</p><p>In Uganda, IntraHealth added a prototype time and attendance tracking module into the Ministry of Health’s version of iHRIS, the flagship human resources solution for health systems and a global public good. Initial results are very encouraging. Unapproved absences dropped 62% across 4,500 pilot facilities as health outcomes improved. The Ugandan program team is now challenged with rolling out their absenteeism system nationwide. At the same time, ministries of health in other countries are looking for similar functionality for their iHRIS deployments as well as biometric identity confirmation for users of OpenMRS, the open source medical record system platform for developing countries.</p><p>In <em>Fighting Absenteeism with Biometrics</em>, IntraHealth International proposes to work with Jembi Health Systems to build on the Ugandan pilot and develop a time and attendance monitoring module for the core iHRIS code base and a biometric user identity system for the OpenMRS code base. This OpenMRS module will provide a much-needed biometric identity functionality to help ministries of health, as well as their constituent facilities, to track and manage health worker attendance and user identities with confidence. These modules will benefit the Ugandan Ministry of Health immediately and will allow the more than 20 other countries that use iHRIS and OpenMRS to deploy time and attendance tracking into their systems, enhancing the ability of human resource managers and facility administrators to mitigate health worker absenteeism and increase the quality and availability of service delivery.</p><h2><strong>II. Consortium Team</strong></h2><p>For 39 years in 100 countries, IntraHealth International has partnered with local communities to make sure health workers are present where they’re needed most, ready to do the job, connected to the technology they need, and safe to do their very best work. IntraHealth International has a long history in developing successful data tools for digital health applications. From mobile apps to management software to multi-language interactive voice response, we offer health workers and managers the tools and technology they need to do their very best work.</p><p>We developed iHRIS, a free and open source software for managing health workforce information, that is utilized in over 20 countries around the world. iHRIS helps countries in low-resource settings capture high-quality data on health worker numbers, skills, qualifications, locations, and more. With this information, nations can address health workforce shortages and solve other challenges across the health sector and beyond.</p><p>The time and attendance module development will be led by the following IntraHealth staff and supported by a full range of health experts, project managers, and back-up software developers:</p><ul><li><p>Luke Duncan, Digital Health Assistant Director, has over 20 years of experience in software development, including leading the developing of iHRIS, the flagship human resources solution for global health, and multiple data interoperability standards and reference designs to connect iHRIS, DHIS2, and OpenMRS. </p></li><li><p><span>Richard Stanley, Senior Technical Advisor, has over 20 years of experience in information and communication technologies, including high-quality research and rapid data analytics for monitoring and evaluations in Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda, Egypt, and Sudan.

Jembi curates the reference technology for the interoperability layer (<a href="http://www.openhim.org/">www.openhim.org</a>) of the<a href="http://www.ohie.org/">OpenHIE</a> and related reference profiles like <a href="https://github.com/jembi/hearth">Hearth</a>.</p><p>The following Jembi staff will support this initiative:</p><ul><li><p>Carl Fourie, Senior Program Manager, has ten years of experience providing insight and guidance to architectural teams and currently leads Jembi's OpenHIE activities.</p></li><li><p>Pierre Dane, Director of Technology, has over 15 years of technical experience and leads Jembi’s technical division with a strong focus on systems development and interoperability.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>III. Project Description</strong></h2><h3><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h3><p>Absenteeism, or unscheduled absence from work, is a persistent problem in health facilities worldwide. The cause of absenteeism among health workers is multifaceted and the result of factors both external and internal to each individual, such as weak workforce leadership or low levels of motivation and compensation. The net effects are clear and highly disruptive to already-struggling health services:</p><ul><li><p>Reduced numbers of staff result in diminished service provision and compromised service quality, as those health workers that do report to work are often overburdened with the tasks of their absent colleagues.</p></li><li><p>Staff who are absent from their assigned duty stations may still be counted—and compensated—as full-time employees, resulting in payroll fraud that robs governments of financial resources for health programs.</p></li><li><p>Absenteeism in the face of pandemic threats is particularly alarming, as an unwillingness to report to work in the midst of an emergency only compounds the crisis and erodes patients’ trust in the health system.</p></li><li><p>Finally, minimum staffing levels are required for governments to achieve quality health outcomes for their citizens and reach goals like universal health coverage (UHC).</p></li></ul><p>Tracking attendance, as part of a comprehensive package of performance management and retention strategies, can help decrease absenteeism and promote greater transparency and accountability in the health sector. In the spirit of trust but verify, biometric methods of identification and collection of attendance data can help ministries of health track if workers are on the job, and how long they are working each day. A number of biometric identification equipment manufacturers, such as SimPrints, have hardware on the market in sub-Saharan Africa with published APIs that can connect to smartphones or laptops to provide data for the attendance record.</p><p><em>iHRIS Time and Attendance Module</em></p><p>In Uganda, the government sought a way to incorporate time and attendance tracking, attendance monitoring tools, and biometric identity management into their version of iHRIS, the flagship human resources solution for health systems and a global public good, that is used by over 20 low and middle income countries to manage health workforce data, including Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Namibia, Botswana, and more.</p><p>Responding to this need, IntraHealth created a prototype iHRIS module for tracking clinical staff in ministry of health facilities. This module incorporates both biometric machines and mobile phones to scan staff fingerprints and produce duty rosters, track attendance, and create human resource summaries. Initial results are very encouraging. Unapproved absences dropped 62% across 4,500 pilot facilities, and there was a statistically significant correlation to increased health outcomes in the same clinics. The initial results are so compelling that Uganda is now challenged to scale the solution nationwide. At the same time, ministries of health in other countries are looking for similar functionality for their iHIRS deployments.</p><p><em>OpenMRS User Verification Module</em></p><p>OpenMRS is the digital health global good for patient medical records that is used in South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Uganda, and many other countries. OpenMRS open source software code can be found at <a href="https://openmrs.org/">https://openmrs.org/</a>. Ministries of health who use OpenMRS seek ways to confirm the identity of OpenMRS users to safeguard patient data and as an indicator of worker attendance.</p><p>An initial UgandaEMR Fingerprint module was developed for OpenMRS deployments in Uganda, yet it is focused on patient identification and it is specific to one technology, the Digital Persona 4500 fingerprint reader from CrossMatch.</p><p>In <em>Fighting Absenteeism with Biometrics</em>, IntraHealth International proposes to work with Jembi Health Systems to build on the Ugandan pilot and develop a time and attendance monitoring module for the core iHRIS code base and a biometric user identity system for the OpenMRS code base that will provide a much-needed biometric identity functionality to help ministries of health, as well as their constituent facilities, to track and manage health worker attendance and user identities with confidence.</p><p>A robust time and attendance monitoring module in the core iHRIS software code will benefit the Ugandan Ministry of Health immediately, and will allow the more than 20 other countries that use iHRIS and OpenMRS to deploy time and attendance tracking and biometric user identity into their systems too, enhancing the ability of human resource managers and facility administrators to mitigate health care worker absenteeism and increase the quality and availability of service delivery.</p><p>The development of a biometrics module for health workers in iHRIS and OpenMRS also offers a pathway for biometric identification for users of DHIS 2.</p><h3><strong>Technical Approach</strong></h3><p>IntraHealth International will build on the Uganda prototype to develop a robust time and attendance module for the core iHRIS software that is based on the Ugandan Ministry of Health use case yet generalized to be applicable to other country contexts. IntraHealth will work with Jembi Health Systems to develop a similar module for OpenMRS that follows the same generalized use case to extend biometric functionality to OpenMRS deployments.</p><p>The initial version of the core iHIRS module will include the following functionality:</p><p><em>Unique User Profile</em></p><p>Each staff member will have a unique user profile that includes basic information like their title, position, duty station, employment status, expected number of days of employment per month, and biometric identifier (i.e. fingerprint, retinal scan, etc.). The actual biometric identifier will be encrypted in a separate database. As attendance is recorded, the profile will be augmented with calculations including days worked, days absent, reason for absence (i.e. sick, leave, training, etc.) and the percentages of each for the month.</p><p><em>Secure Biometric Identity</em></p><p>The module will interact with a representative sample of existing third-party biometric machines and mobile phone applications that are already on the market in Uganda and across sub-Saharan Africa. These biometric identity solutions will be configured so that biometric data will be encrypted and not accessible to unauthorized staff. The solutions will only confirm that the biometric marker is in its file and linked to a unique user identity, positively matching with the presented biometric marker.</p><p><em>Comprehensive Reporting</em></p><p>The attendance data can be queried on multiple levels, including analyzed on a per-person, per-facility, and per administrative region basis, based on the user permissions of the data requestor. Regular duty rosters and attendance reports will be automatically sent to the respective parties who need to know, such as the facility manager, regional manager, and payroll manager. A national dashboard with anonymized data will be available to the public for greater health system accountability.</p><p>This suite of time tracking and biometric identity functionality will enable the success of the Ugandan pilot to be replicated across the country and shared across iHRIS deployments, increasing iHRIS’ utility as a trusted human resource management system and global public health good. </p><p><em>OpenMRS User Verification</em></p><p>Jembi will build on the core iHRIS module’s <em>Secure Biometric Identity</em> solution and adapt it for OpenMRS user identity use cases. At this point, we believe that OpenMRS biometric user identity use cases will be complementary to the core functionality of the iHRIS module and the bulk of Jembi’s software development activity will be developing the specific biometric identity interface to OpenMRS.</p><h3><strong>Use of Digital Health Technologies</strong></h3><p>We anticipate that this activity will utilize the following digital health tools, technologies, and standards:</p><ul><li><p>iHRIS: Source code is available via <a href="http://ihris.org/">http://iHRIS.org</a> under a GPL V3 license.</p></li><li><p>OpenMRS: Source code is available via <a href="https://openmrs.org/">https://openmrs.org/</a> under Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.</p></li><li><p>UgandaEMR Fingerprint Module: Source code is available via <a href="https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/UgandaEMR+FingerPrint+Module">https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/UgandaEMR+FingerPrint+Module</a> under Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.</p></li><li><p>ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37 on Biometrics found at <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/international-biometrics-standards">https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/international-biometrics-standard</a></p></li></ul><h3><strong>Work Plan, Schedule, and Deliverables</strong></h3><p><strong>Month 1-2: Phase 1 - Functionality Definition.</strong> Work with the Ugandan Ministry of Health and the South African Ministry of Health to gather additional requirements and use cases to enhance the current prototype software and assess the landscape of biometric identity solutions available across sub-Saharan Africa.

We will also bring in stakeholders from other governments to ensure our modules have the greatest overall utility across multiple countries.</p><p>Once we begin Phase 4, we’ll evaluate our overall efforts to measure how well we’ve met our initial objectives and the extent to which the new modules are allowing software developers and country governments to build comprehensive performance management and retention strategies that decrease absenteeism and promote greater transparency and accountability in the health sector.</p><h2><strong>IV. Two-Sentence Overview</strong></h2><p><em>Fighting Absenteeism with Biometrics</em> will help health systems better manage scarce frontline health worker resources, and achieve Universal Health Coverage goals, by verifying users of iHRIS and OpenMRS, two widely used health systems solutions, and tracking their time and attendance at their duty stations.</p><p>Digital Square will be funding IntraHealth International and Jembi Health Systems to develop a time and attendance monitoring module for the core iHRIS code base and a biometric user identity system for the OpenMRS code base that will provide a much-needed biometric identity functionality to help ministries of health, as well as their constituent facilities, to track and manage health worker attendance and user identities with confidence.</p><h2><strong>V. Community Feedback</strong></h2><p>Our key engagement point with the broader digital health community will be through our advisory group, made up of representative software developers and policy-makers. This group will be initially populated from the Ugandan context, as that’s the origination point for our initial use cases. We’ll aim to quickly expand this group by bringing in iHRIS and OpenMRS experts from their respective communities and health policy experts from the Global Digital Health Network, and similar technology and policy communities.</p><p>We expect this advisory group to give regular input and guidance on the technology solution design and the context in which it will work, including:</p><ul><li>Use cases to inform software development and testing</li><li>Technology choices, especially biometric devices</li><li>Software architecture to ensure interoperability with existing systems</li></ul><p>As we proceed through the development process, we will engage with the advisory group through regular check-ins at the start and end of each phase, to make sure that we are still building toward our future vision. We will also bring in stakeholders from across the greater digital health community at the end of each phase to ensure our modules have the greatest overall utility across multiple countries.</p><h2><strong>VI. Use Cases, User Stories</strong></h2><p><em>Health Worker at iHRIS Facility</em></p><p>Health worker is able to indicate they are present at the health facility by checking into it via iHRIS, using both a login and a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint. The biometric identifier confirms the person checking in is the staff member, and not someone who has access to the staff member’s user ID and password. The same process is repeated when the staff member leaves the health facility to check them out of the facility. The iHRIS module uses these check-in and check-out activities to calculate the staff member’s time at the facility.</p><p><em>iHRIS Facility Staff Managers</em></p><p>The staffing manager at an iHRIS facility can log into iHRIS and develop a duty roster of which staff should be working which shifts at the facility over specific time periods, for example, 8 hour shifts over the next month, who is not expected to work and if needed, why they are not scheduled for duty (ie. vacation, training, other excused absences).</p><p>Staffing manager can view reports on individual and aggregate staff time and attendance at that facility and analyze the data. The district, regional, and national staffing managers can login to iHRIS and see staffing trends down to the facility level and analyze the data. Data analysis can include trends at a specific facility and its attendance performance relative to other facilities, regions, etc.</p><p><em>Health Worker at OpenMRS Facility</em></p><p>Health worker is able to log into OpenMRS by confirming their identity using both a login and a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint. The biometric identifier confirms the person logging in is the staff member and not someone who has access to the staff member’s user ID and password. The login activity is repeated whenever the user logs in. Time at the facility is not tracked.</p><p><em>OpenMRS Manager</em></p><p>OpenMRS manager at a facility can view individual and aggregate facility reports on logins by staff and attempted or failed logins, and analyze the data. District, regional, or national OpenMRS managers can view reports down to the facility level and analyze the data.
