It operates a free, secure Digital Health Platform allowing patients, providers and other health care stakeholders to easily access and manage personal health information from their phone or computer. The platform is currently deployed within several African and Asian countries in partnership with Ministries of Health, local hospitals and physicians, and by the Red Cross. PocketPatientMD is also a founding member of the Africa CDC Task Force on digital health currently advising the African Union, and was recently named one of the Top 100 early-stage companies for 2022 by the New York VC Network.

PocketPatientMD strengthens health systems by reducing the current strain on resources and cost and quality of care, by giving payers, providers, and patients access to accurate health records and information, and by assisting with the economic and health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through newly added detection and contact tracing tools. The core function of the platform is a Universal Electronic Health record that can connect to labs, pharmacies, diagnostic centers, and the offices of relevant public health officials. Additional platform features include one-click translation to seven languages (with 12 additional languages in beta), an offline mode and prescription gamification to drive compliance. PocketPatientMD works on any device and with all operating systems, is interoperable with all existing systems, platforms, and applications, and is customizable to meet the needs of any healthcare stakeholder, clinical setting, or population.

Currently, PocketPatientMD has over 10,000 medical records on the platform. The platform has been tested in over 35 African countries by doctors on the ground, as well as in Asia and the Americas. The platform’s COVID-19 diagnostic and contact tracing tools are currently being utilized by a leading global health agency and to track an ongoing agency and government outbreak in an Asian country. Currently, over 30 Ministries of Health in Africa have been sent MOUs or are in late stages of deciding upon pilot implementation, in addition to other public and private organizations and Ministries of Health in Asia and the Americas. One African country has signed off on a country wide pilot, contingent upon obtaining basic hardware support, such as computers to initiate the pilot.

PocketPatientMD’s monetization model is centered on aggregated reports and meta-data, and the intersection of mega trends, providing analysis and information to health sector stakeholders, including pharmaceutical firms, device manufacturers, and insurance companies in order to improve logistics and reduce costs through better sourcing of medications and equipment, reduced waste, improved patient compliance, and better understanding of health across populations and communities.

PocketPatientMD’s founder and investors have contributed over $500,000 of capital, including $230,000 in investment most recently at a valuation of $6MM USD in August 2019. PocketPatientMD has been featured on CNN, Newsweek, and has established multiple partnerships including with HIMSS and Health Finance Institute.

PocketPatientMD is at the stage of catalytic scale, and seeking grant funding as the the company prepares to implement pilots in three (3) target countries and provide basic hardware and data/wifi subsidies, hire local consultants to assist on the ground, and complete offline version of application and new tech developents. Within 60 days of the close of the next round a minimum of 3 new pilots will be initiated, leading to over 100,000 new records on the platform within 12 months.

PocketPatientMD is also a founding member of the Africa CDC Task Force on digital health currently advising the African Union. The platform is in multiple languages including English, French, Portuguese, Arabic, and Swahili. The platform is currently beta in Amharic, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Kinyarwandan, and Malagasy, in addition to several others.

PocketPatientMD strengthens health systems by reducing the current strain on resources and cost and quality of care, by giving payers, providers, and patients access to accurate health records and information, and by assisting with the economic and health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through newly added detection and contact tracing tools. The core function of the platform is a Universal Electronic Health record that can connect to labs, pharmacies, diagnostic centers, and the offices of relevant public health officials. Additional platform features include one-click translation to seven languages (with 12 additional languages in beta), an offline mode and prescription gamification to drive compliance. PocketPatientMD works on any device and with all operating systems, is interoperable with all existing systems, platforms, and applications, and is customizable to meet the needs of any healthcare stakeholder, clinical setting, or population.

The platform has been tested in over 35 African countries by doctors on the ground, as well as in Asia and the Americas, including in use by the Red Cross. The platform’s COVID-19 diagnostic and contact tracing tools are currently being utilized by a leading global health agency and to track an ongoing agency and government outbreak in an Asian country. 


Proposal

PocketPatientMD proposes to provide its platform to doctors, patients, Ministries of Health, and hospital organizations at no cost. This includes working with the WHO, local, and national partners to include additional features including access to accurate medical histories including vaccination histories. The platform already includes features including patient follow-up features to ensure compliance for medications, appointments, and scheduling; and capturing patient medical histories to also enable health systems to remain resilient and rebound from the reduction in non-essential care and patient compliance. This includes the ability to make customizations based upon feedback from users.

PocketPatientMD can be utilized by any healthcare professional. Being a permission-based system, the input can be adapted to meet the needs of any government, organization, or health system including roles for community health workers, nurses, receptionists, pharmacists, and other frontline health workers including community health workers and midives. This can be universally accessible, customized for any country or user, and include additional features as needed. It will also prove real-time analytics and follow-up for users reducing waste and increasing procurement opportunities.

PocketPatientMD is already providing these features and recommends deploying them on the ground in 4 countries through partners on the ground in countries we have Ministry of Health approval. Partner countries for this pilot could include:
•	Kenya
•	The Gambia
•	Ivory Coast
•	Congo-Brazzaville
•	DRC
•	Madagascar
•	South Sudan
•	Philippines

PocketPatientMD would also have the ability to introduce these features to its existing physician base for additional usage and Ministries of Health we already have agreements to pilot with.

Problem

PocketPatientMD addresses several problems resulting from health information being on paper and a lack of accurate, accountable health information in many populations and countries: costly care of varying quality; inconsistent compliance with best medical practice guidelines; lack of follow-up for health prevention and maintenance; and health systems lacking resiliency. Resilient, responsive health systems require timely access to accurate health information- where PocketPatientMD comes in.

Many countries lack reliable information on the overall health of their populations, including on disease prevalence and incidence. Patient compliance suffers, impacting all stakeholders: physicians, patients, health systems, Ministries of Health, insurers, device and pharmaceutical firms.
Providers often run out of supplies and medications. Pharmaceutical firms lack accurate information about drug demand, affecting logistics. Clinical trials and research lag. Existing systems are expensive, confusing, or focused on billing and statistics and not the clinical setting. 

Most importantly: Doctors are resorting to insecure, unsafe methods to record patient records including GoogleDrive, Microsoft Word, Evernote, and Dropbox.

Establishing a more robust, diversified health information management system-and encouraging use through user-friendly interfaces and design- PocketPatientMD protects populations by tracking and monitoring care. Health and economic resilience is improved- establishing baseline figures for cost and use of treatments, improving transparency and functioning of supply chains. In pandemic situations, this enables faster, more effective responses and better managed care. PocketPatientMD offers an interoperable, customizable system supporting all care, providing a more complete picture of health systems costs and costs of managing risk.

One immediate example of how PocketPatientMD can provide an immediate impact is with vaccines. Vaccines are the most important life saving drugs. They prevent debilitating, life-long, and often deadly illnesses. Vaccines prevent some of the most costly illnesses- impacting families, health systems, and society as whole. Even brief interruptions of vaccination activities make outbreaks more likely to occur, putting children and other vulnerable groups more at risk of serious diseases.

Vaccines are typically logged on a vaccination card given to parents and on the physicians paper records. These cards are frequently lost, misplaced, or destroyed leaving the patient no way to access this information if they go to a different physician, and a new physician no way to verify the patients vaccination history without straining resources doing additional tests to check antibody rates, increasing cost of care or providing redundant care by giving unnecessary boosters or follow-up vaccines. There is a significant cost in terms of time, wasted resources, and avoidable illnesses.

With COVID19 pandemic and the reduction in non-essential care, vaccination rates globally, especially among children dropped to historic lows, with over 80million children missing out on vaccines in the past year according to the WHO. Additionally, Africa has been experiencing a resurgence of measles. Measles preventive mass vaccination campaigns in Chad, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Sudan have been suspended because of COVID-19, leaving around 21 million children who would have been vaccinated, unprotected as of mid-2020.


Solution

PocketPatientMD allows doctors to move from paper-based records to digital, providing real time access to health information and data, improving care and decision making for all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. This includes all providers including individual doctors, Ministries of Health, hospital networks, insurers, pharmaceutical firms, and device manufacturers.

As part of a permission based system, these tools can be utilized by all frontline workers and others in the healthcare ecosystem, including community health workers and midwives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also being added by physicians to improve triage, medical case management, and improve resiliency by assisting other frontline workers, midwives, community health workers, and other medical professionals.
With healthcare remaining a top-3 line item in terms of percent of GDP for most countries globally, opportunities exist for profound savings through better patient compliance and improved health of populations. It is impossible to build resilient health systems when communities and countries don&#039;t have accurate information about the health of their populations. This provides an opportunity to reduce waste and the strain of the global physician shortage by allowing doctors to see more patients, more quickly by accessing better information.

The platform includes contact tracing and a printable vaccination card. It is in multiple languages, providing seamless translation as patients cross borders. The platform is also interoperable and able to link with existing systems and applications, diagnostic centers, pharmacies, and more. This includes existing platforms, such as DHIS2 and OpenMRS. It is also customizable to constantly adapt to the changes in the medical community, always meet the standards and best practices, and allow physicians and health systems to include and gather new information important to them from research to public health informatics.
The platform has online and offline capabilities, ensuring that in areas with poor access to internet or cellular data the platform can still be utilized. Once connectivity returns, or a user returns to an area with connectivity, everything is synced back up.

The platform is currently in multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Swahili, and Vietnamese, and beta in 11 others including Amharic, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Kinyarwandan, Malagasy, and more. This enables physicians and healthcare workers to provide a higher standard of care by accessing an accurate picture of a patient&#039;s current medical history to provide better cost and quality of care, even if there are language barriers.

The platform is live and has been tested and used in over 35 countries in Africa, as well as multiple countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, and South and Central America. The platform has also been used for COVID19 responses in multiple countries. It was used successfully for contact tracing in one Asian country, and in one African country showed a 50% improvement in COVID19 morbidity and mortality in just 4-weeks by enabling physicians and front-line health workers to more easily follow-up and monitor cases in real time. PocketPatientMD&#039;s work was also featured on CNN.

PocketPatientMD provides a universally accessible vaccination record that patients and physicians can access- ensuring universal access to this life-saving and integral preventative health information. All vaccines are added and updated by health professionals on the PocketPatientMD platform ensuring a licensed medical professional has input accurate, accountable information.

Additional Opportunities

PocketPatientMD aims to serve all healthcare stakeholders-physicians, Ministries of Health, hospital networks, and other frontline workers including community health workers, midwives, pharmacists and lab technicians- so that they can provide better cost and quality of care, and remain well themselves. The platform also benefits insurers, pharmaceutical firms, device manufacturers, medical schools, medical students, and others in the healthcare ecosystem by helping to identify treatments, supplies, and protocols that will best address patients&#039; needs. Its success is dependent on where care begins- clinical visits and the key physician-patient interaction and relationship.

PocketPatientMD provides support with videos and instruction manuals in multiple languages, remote trainings, and by continuing to build and establish relationships with physicians, Ministries of Health, and other health professionals on the ground in each country.

PocketPatientMD and its founder have traveled to and met with physicians, Ministries of Health, First Ladies and their Foundations, and other health professionals across Southeast Asia and most notably in over 35 African countries. On-the-ground training was provided, and the company received firsthand feedback directly from physicians and other stakeholders, and used what was learned to further customize and enhance the platform. We continue to engage these individuals and grow our network today.



Collaboration with WHO and other Partners for Vaccination Histories

Policymakers and parents can agree that losing a child’s (or your own) paper vaccination card or immunization history is very inconvenient, but it can also have serious repercussions on someone’s health and often results in wasted resources.

We transform vaccination histories:

from this…				    to this…

 

These can be customized to meet the standards set by any government, organization, or institution.

PocketPatientMD is offering its secure Digital Vaccination History to all stakeholders at no cost.
Everyone, including parents, doctors, hospitals, and even Ministers, can keep their vaccination
record safe and accessible. A certified healthcare provider will capture the information at the
time the vaccine is administered. For existing paper records, the provider can upload a
photograph of a patient’s existing paper record and transcribe the values into the digital file so
a copy of the original is maintained.

With PocketPatientMD’s completely free Digital Vaccination History, parents and patients will
never lose their vaccination records again, and the Ministry of Health and organizations will be able to more
easily, accurately, and efficiently track vaccination rates throughout the country. They will also better be able to track supply and demand to ensure compliance and successful vaccination of populations.
